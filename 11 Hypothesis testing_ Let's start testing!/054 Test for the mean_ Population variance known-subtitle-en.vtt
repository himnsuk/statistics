00:00.770 --> 00:01.770
All right.

00:01.850 --> 00:06.490
Now that we've covered the necessary theory it is time for some testing.

00:06.610 --> 00:13.970
We are going to explore two types of tests drawn from a single population and drawn from multiple populations.

00:13.970 --> 00:19.280
This is very similar to confidence intervals for a single population and confidence intervals for two

00:19.280 --> 00:23.550
populations that we covered previously in the next few videos.

00:23.570 --> 00:28.760
We all run tests for a single mean with both known variants and unknown variants.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.430
Let's start with the test in which the variance is known.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.970
Shall we for this test.

00:33.970 --> 00:37.330
We will use our good old data scientist salary example.

00:37.540 --> 00:40.770
Here's the data set one more time by now.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.600
I hope you are able to calculate the sample mean.

00:43.900 --> 00:47.130
It is one hundred thousand two hundred dollars.

00:47.210 --> 00:52.630
The population variance is known and its standard deviation is equal to $15000.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.420
Moreover the sample size is 30.

00:56.470 --> 01:03.250
However you saw that according to Glassdoor the popular Salang information Web site the mean data scientists

01:03.250 --> 01:06.520
Sellery is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

01:06.640 --> 01:12.370
The sample that is available on glass door is based on self-reported numbers and you would like to see

01:12.430 --> 01:14.330
if its value is correct.

01:14.350 --> 01:20.110
We needed a two sided test as we were interested in knowing both if the celery is significantly less

01:20.110 --> 01:23.520
than that or significantly more than that.

01:23.560 --> 01:29.660
The null hypothesis is the population mean celery is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

01:29.830 --> 01:34.360
We denote it as muse 0 equals one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

01:34.360 --> 01:39.330
The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean celery is different than one hundred thirteen

01:39.320 --> 01:42.250
thousand dollars all right.

01:42.310 --> 01:49.450
Formula time almost testing is done by standardizing the variable at hand and comparing it to the lower

01:49.450 --> 01:53.190
case Z which follows a standard normal distribution.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.490
Remember standardization we learned about it in the previous section.

01:57.490 --> 02:02.120
Back then I told you it was very important and you will now see why.

02:02.200 --> 02:07.770
For those that don't remember I suggest watching the video on sterilization once again for the others.

02:07.810 --> 02:10.030
I will quickly go through it.

02:10.100 --> 02:15.290
We standardize a variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.880
Since it is a sample we use the standard error.

02:18.920 --> 02:26.720
Thus the formula for standardization becomes capital Z is equal to the sample mean minus the value of

02:26.750 --> 02:31.040
interest from the null hypothesis divided by the standard error.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.610
In this way we obtain a distribution with a mean of zero.

02:34.610 --> 02:41.750
Any standard deviation of one the upper case z should not be mistaken with the lowercase Z.

02:41.750 --> 02:47.360
The uppercase Z is the standardized variable associated with the test and will be called the Z score.

02:47.360 --> 02:53.450
From now on the lower case c is the one from the table that we talked about before and henceforth will

02:53.450 --> 02:58.240
be referred to as the critical value all.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.740
How does testing work.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.140
Think about this.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.550
The lowercase Z is normally distributed with a mean of 0.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.590
Any standard deviation of 1.

03:07.770 --> 03:14.070
The upper case C is normally distributed with a mean of X bar minus music Museo any standard deviation

03:14.100 --> 03:15.450
of 1.

03:15.450 --> 03:18.590
Standardization lets us compare the means.

03:18.600 --> 03:26.710
The closer the difference of X bar amuse 0 to zero the closer the z score itself to zero this implies

03:26.770 --> 03:29.720
a higher chance to accept the null hypothesis.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.360
Let's go back to the example.

03:33.050 --> 03:38.720
So what is the value of our standardized variable replug in the numbers that we have from the beginning

03:38.720 --> 03:39.910
of the lesson.

03:40.070 --> 03:44.550
What we get is a z score of minus 4.6 7.

03:44.630 --> 03:51.710
Now we will compare the absolute value of minus 4.6 7 with a lower case Z of Alpha divided by 2 where

03:51.770 --> 03:54.370
Alpha is the significance level.

03:54.380 --> 04:00.500
Note that we use the absolute value as it is much easier to always compare positive capital Zee's with

04:00.500 --> 04:02.750
positive lower cases.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.740
Moreover some tables don't include negative values.

04:06.770 --> 04:13.070
You should be aware that the two statements minus 4.6 seven is lower than the negative critical value

04:13.250 --> 04:19.240
is the same as 4.6 7 is higher than the positive critical value.

04:19.250 --> 04:25.850
Thus our decision rule becomes absolute value of the z score should be higher than the absolute value

04:25.850 --> 04:30.390
of the critical value using 5 percent significance.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.350
Our Alpha is 0.05.

04:33.450 --> 04:40.800
Since it is a two sided test we check the table for Z of zero point zero to five the corresponding value

04:40.860 --> 04:43.280
is 1.9 6.

04:43.290 --> 04:48.160
The last thing we need to compare our standardized variable to is the critical value.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.360
If the z score is higher than 1.9 6 we would reject the null hypothesis.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.100
If it is lower we will accept it.

04:56.580 --> 05:00.030
4.6 7 is higher than 1.9 6.

05:00.090 --> 05:03.360
Therefore we reject the null hypothesis.

05:03.360 --> 05:10.170
The answer is that at 5 percent significance level we have rejected the null hypothesis or at 5 percent

05:10.170 --> 05:11.130
significance.

05:11.130 --> 05:17.180
There is no statistical evidence that the mean salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

05:17.190 --> 05:21.660
There are many other ways to express this and you will probably hear more about this later on in the

05:21.660 --> 05:28.340
course what if we had a different significance level using 1 percent significance.

05:28.350 --> 05:30.990
We have an alpha of zero point zero or one.

05:30.990 --> 05:35.450
So Z of Alpha divided by 2 is 2.5 8.

05:35.460 --> 05:42.840
Once again our z score a 4.6 7 is higher than 2.5 8 so we would reject the no hypothesis.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.960
Even at the 1 percent significance.

05:46.160 --> 05:51.280
But how much further can we go before we cannot reject the null hypothesis anymore.

05:51.300 --> 05:55.150
Zero point five percent 0.1 percent.

05:55.190 --> 06:00.500
There is a special technique that allows us to see what the significance of all is after which we will

06:00.500 --> 06:03.520
be unable to reject the no hypothesis.

06:03.770 --> 06:06.290
We will see in our next video.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.520
Stay tuned.

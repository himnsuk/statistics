1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,770
All right.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,490
Now that we've covered the necessary theory it is time for some testing.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:13,970
We are going to explore two types of tests drawn from a single population and drawn from multiple populations.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,280
This is very similar to confidence intervals for a single population and confidence intervals for two

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,550
populations that we covered previously in the next few videos.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,760
We all run tests for a single mean with both known variants and unknown variants.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,430
Let's start with the test in which the variance is known.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,970
Shall we for this test.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,330
We will use our good old data scientist salary example.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,770
Here's the data set one more time by now.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,600
I hope you are able to calculate the sample mean.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,130
It is one hundred thousand two hundred dollars.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,630
The population variance is known and its standard deviation is equal to $15000.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,420
Moreover the sample size is 30.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,250
However you saw that according to Glassdoor the popular Salang information Web site the mean data scientists

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,520
Sellery is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,370
The sample that is available on glass door is based on self-reported numbers and you would like to see

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,330
if its value is correct.

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,110
We needed a two sided test as we were interested in knowing both if the celery is significantly less

20
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,520
than that or significantly more than that.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,660
The null hypothesis is the population mean celery is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,360
We denote it as muse 0 equals one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,330
The alternative hypothesis is that the population mean celery is different than one hundred thirteen

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,250
thousand dollars all right.

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:49,450
Formula time almost testing is done by standardizing the variable at hand and comparing it to the lower

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,190
case Z which follows a standard normal distribution.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,490
Remember standardization we learned about it in the previous section.

28
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,120
Back then I told you it was very important and you will now see why.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,770
For those that don't remember I suggest watching the video on sterilization once again for the others.

30
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,030
I will quickly go through it.

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,290
We standardize a variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,880
Since it is a sample we use the standard error.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,720
Thus the formula for standardization becomes capital Z is equal to the sample mean minus the value of

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,040
interest from the null hypothesis divided by the standard error.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,610
In this way we obtain a distribution with a mean of zero.

36
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,750
Any standard deviation of one the upper case z should not be mistaken with the lowercase Z.

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,360
The uppercase Z is the standardized variable associated with the test and will be called the Z score.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,450
From now on the lower case c is the one from the table that we talked about before and henceforth will

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,240
be referred to as the critical value all.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,740
How does testing work.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,140
Think about this.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,550
The lowercase Z is normally distributed with a mean of 0.

43
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,590
Any standard deviation of 1.

44
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,070
The upper case C is normally distributed with a mean of X bar minus music Museo any standard deviation

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,450
of 1.

46
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,590
Standardization lets us compare the means.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,710
The closer the difference of X bar amuse 0 to zero the closer the z score itself to zero this implies

48
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,720
a higher chance to accept the null hypothesis.

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,360
Let's go back to the example.

50
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:38,720
So what is the value of our standardized variable replug in the numbers that we have from the beginning

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,910
of the lesson.

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,550
What we get is a z score of minus 4.6 7.

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:51,710
Now we will compare the absolute value of minus 4.6 7 with a lower case Z of Alpha divided by 2 where

54
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,370
Alpha is the significance level.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,500
Note that we use the absolute value as it is much easier to always compare positive capital Zee's with

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
positive lower cases.

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,740
Moreover some tables don't include negative values.

58
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,070
You should be aware that the two statements minus 4.6 seven is lower than the negative critical value

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,240
is the same as 4.6 7 is higher than the positive critical value.

60
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,850
Thus our decision rule becomes absolute value of the z score should be higher than the absolute value

61
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,390
of the critical value using 5 percent significance.

62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,350
Our Alpha is 0.05.

63
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:40,800
Since it is a two sided test we check the table for Z of zero point zero to five the corresponding value

64
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,280
is 1.9 6.

65
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,160
The last thing we need to compare our standardized variable to is the critical value.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,360
If the z score is higher than 1.9 6 we would reject the null hypothesis.

67
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,100
If it is lower we will accept it.

68
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,030
4.6 7 is higher than 1.9 6.

69
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,360
Therefore we reject the null hypothesis.

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,170
The answer is that at 5 percent significance level we have rejected the null hypothesis or at 5 percent

71
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,130
significance.

72
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,180
There is no statistical evidence that the mean salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

73
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,660
There are many other ways to express this and you will probably hear more about this later on in the

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,340
course what if we had a different significance level using 1 percent significance.

75
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,990
We have an alpha of zero point zero or one.

76
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,450
So Z of Alpha divided by 2 is 2.5 8.

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,840
Once again our z score a 4.6 7 is higher than 2.5 8 so we would reject the no hypothesis.

78
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Even at the 1 percent significance.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,280
But how much further can we go before we cannot reject the null hypothesis anymore.

80
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,150
Zero point five percent 0.1 percent.

81
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,500
There is a special technique that allows us to see what the significance of all is after which we will

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,520
be unable to reject the no hypothesis.

83
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,290
We will see in our next video.

84
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,520
Stay tuned.

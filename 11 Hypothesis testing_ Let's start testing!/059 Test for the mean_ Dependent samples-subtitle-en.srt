1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,360
We are not done with Hypothesis Testing just yet remember how we started with confidence intervals for

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,320
a single population mean and then switched to examples considering multiple populations.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,750
While we are in the same situation here single populations are just the beginning time to do multiple

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,960
means.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,010
We will start with dependent samples.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,260
The most intuitive examples of dependent samples are the ones you have been through like weight loss

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,960
and blood tests.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,440
The sample is drawn from Weight-Loss data or concentration of nutrient data.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,780
But the subject of interest is the same person before and after OK let's get to work.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,480
Do you recall our example with the magnesium levels in one's blood.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:52,670
There was this drug company developing a new pill that supposably increased levels of magnesium of recipients.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,530
There were 10 people involved in the study that were taking the drug for some time and we calculated

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,470
confidence intervals that helped us study the effects of that drug.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,640
They indicated the range of plausible values for the population mean.

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,960
This time we want to come to a single definite conclusion about the effectiveness of the drug.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,560
All right.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,230
Let's state the no hypothesis.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:22,010
The population mean before is greater or equal than the population mean after the alternative is that

19
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,210
the population mean before is lower than the one after.

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,980
Once again we want to know if the magnesium levels are higher.

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,530
We construct a no and alternative hypotheses in such a way so that we are aiming to reject the null

22
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,060
hypothesis.

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,300
OK let's reorder a bit.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:48,340
Age 0 is myu before which is equal or higher than mu after this is equivalent to MMU before minus myu

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,710
after is equal to zero or positive.

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,480
We can substitute this with capital D 0 it stands for the hypothesized population mean difference.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,710
So we restate our hypotheses using d for simplicity.

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,230
Now we have our test designed.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
Let's crunch some numbers.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,720
Here's the data set.

31
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,390
We have 10 observations people have registered before and after.

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,050
Naturally the difference is equal to before minus after we can calculate the sample mean of the difference

33
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,310
we get minus 0.3 3.

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,730
The sample standard deviation is zero point four or five.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:35,570
And the standard error is 0.1 for the appropriate statistic to use here is the t statistic.

36
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,040
We have a small sample.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,130
We assume normal distribution of the population and we don't know the variance.

38
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,000
So the score is equal to the following expression.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,530
Now we can simply carry up the calculations and find that its value is minus 2.2 none since we don't

40
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,620
want to choose a level of significance.

41
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,270
Well solve the problem with the P-value in order to find the value of this one sided test.

42
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:08,930
We may go to the table and see it is somewhere between zero point zero one and zero point zero to five.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,060
As I told you earlier using software is much easier.

44
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:20,280
So after using an online P-value calculator I can tell you that it is exactly zero point zero to four.

45
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,560
What was that decision rule again.

46
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,330
If the p value is lower than the significance level we are interested in.

47
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,000
We reject the no hypothesis.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,530
OK so if the level of significance is 0.05 and the p value is lower we will be able to reject the hypothesis

49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,510
at 5 percent if the level of significance is zero point zero one however the p value is higher.

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,470
So we cannot reject the no hypothesis at a 1 percent level of significance.

51
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:56,530
The lowest value for which we can reject it is zero point zero to four which is exactly the p value.

52
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,320
What does this tell us.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,290
Well it is up to the researcher to choose the level of significance in the case of the magnesium pill.

54
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,840
We expect that the researcher will be very cautious as he would want to know if this is an effective

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,160
pill they will be able to actually help people.

56
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,540
If we cannot say that the pill works at a 1 percent significance level perhaps it is better to take

57
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,780
it back to the laboratory and alternative would be to test again and increase the sample size for better

58
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,750
results.

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,740
A sample of 100 people would improve the level of precision significantly.

60
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,560
All right so we've done some more hypothesis testing and we've explored some factors that help you determine

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,050
the significance level of the test.

62
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,850
Stay with us for our next lesson where we will learn how to test independent samples.

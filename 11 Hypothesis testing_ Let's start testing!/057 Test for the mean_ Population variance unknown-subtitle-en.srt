1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,420
All right.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,650
Great.

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:08,530
Now that we know what the value is and how to use it we will give back to hypothesis testing.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,380
We saw only one of the two possible cases.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:18,120
Remember we haven't covered the more commonly observed case when the population variance is unknown.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,970
All right.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,310
Imagine you are the marketing analyst of a company and you've been asked to estimate if the e-mail open

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,240
rate of one of the firm's competitors is above your company's.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,640
Your company has an open rate of 40 percent an email open rate is a measure of how many people on the

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,070
e-mail list actually open the e-mails they have received.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,600
At first you struggled to figure out how to get such specific information about a competitor company

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:50,170
but then you see that an employee of that competitor company posted a selfie on Facebook saying oh well

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,060
the e-mail management software we are using drives me nuts in the background.

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,460
You can see her screen and it shows clearly the summaries of the last 10 email campaigns that were sent

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,720
and their corresponding open rates.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,780
Bingo with your statistical skills.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,560
That's all you need a little help from Facebook.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:18,680
Let's stay the hypotheses no hypothesis mean open rate is lower or equal to 40 percent.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,230
Alternative Hypothesis mean open rate is higher than 40 percent.

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,570
No.

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,100
That in hypothesis testing we are aiming to reject the no hypothesis when we want to test if the open

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,860
rate is higher than 40 percent.

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,540
The null hypothesis actually states the opposite statement.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,200
Also pay attention that this time we're dealing with a one sided test.

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,930
All right.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,030
Your boss told you that 0.05 is an adequate significance level for this test.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,500
So that's what you'll use.

28
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,210
Here's the data set you calculate the sample mean and get thirty seven point seven percent.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,480
The sample standard deviation is thirteen point seventy four percent.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,840
Thus the standard error is 1.3 7 percent.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,650
You assume that the population of open rates of sent e-mails is normally distributed like confidence

32
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,440
intervals with variants are known and a small sample.

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,280
The correct statistic to use is the t statistic.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,780
Remember you do not know the variance and the sample is not big enough.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,760
This means that the variable follows the Student's t distribution and you must employ the t statistic

36
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:36,230
let's calculate it then we calculate the T score the same way as the Z score the T score is equal to

37
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,140
the sample mean minus the hypothesized mean value divided by the standard error.

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:50,090
The result that we get is minus 1.6 7 as we said earlier is easier to work with positive numbers so

39
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,480
we should compare the absolute value of minus 1.6 7 with the appropriate t with and minus 1 degrees

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,160
of freedom at 0.05 one sided significance.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,830
We quickly navigate through the table and get 1.8 three at the 5 percent significance critical value

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,270
OK 1.6 7 is lower than 1.8 3.

43
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,890
Remember the decision rule.

44
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,430
If the absolute value of the T score is lower than the statistic from the table we cannot reject the

45
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,050
no hypothesis.

46
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,650
Therefore we must accept it.

47
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,260
What you do next is you go and tell your boss that at this level of significance statistically we cannot

48
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,350
say that the evil open rate of our competitors is higher than 40 percent.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,910
What about the second measurement we saw.

50
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,080
What was that.

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:49,890
Ah yes the p value the p value of this statistic is 0.06 5 as the p value is greater than the significance

52
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,670
level of 0.05.

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,670
We come to the same conclusion.

54
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,260
We cannot reject the null hypothesis.

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,580
Let's do a quick check if the significance level was zero point zero or one the p value would still

56
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,110
be higher and we wouldn't reject the null hypothesis.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,340
This is an important observation that we haven't noted before.

58
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:18,200
If we cannot reject a test at 0.05 significance we cannot reject it at smaller levels either.

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,340
All right that's all for now.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,180
Make sure you learn the material by doing the exercises.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,860
After this lesson.

62
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,980
Thanks for watching.

1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,430
High again as you probably expected in this lesson we will learn about independent samples with known

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,470
variants.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,630
Once get into the example you may remember this one we are about to test the average grades of students

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,300
from two departments in a UK university.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,310
I would like to remind you that in the UK grades are expressed in percentages.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,490
The two departments are engineering and management.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,040
We were told by the Dean that engineering is a tougher discipline and people tend to get lower grades.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,700
He believes that on average management students outperform engineering students by four percentage points.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,450
Now it is our job to verify if that is the case.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,940
Let's state the two hypotheses age zero is the difference between the means of the two populations is

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,190
for or stated differently.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,750
New engineering minus new management is equal to minus four.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,510
H1 is the population mean.

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,940
Difference is different than minus for.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,970
Once again this is a two sided test.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,550
Our research question is not to find the difference but to check if it is exactly the minus for right.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,580
Let's get our hands dirty.

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,250
Here's the table that summarizes the data.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,820
The sample sizes are 170 respectively.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,080
The sample means are 58 percent and 65 percent and the population standard deviations are 10 percent

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,100
and 6 percent and are known from the past data.

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,510
If you remember when the population is known for independent samples the standard error of the difference

23
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:40,060
is equal to the square root of the sum of the variance of engineering divided by its simple size and

24
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,570
the variance of management.

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,530
Again divided by sample size.

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,830
All we have left is to compute the test autistic.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,770
We have big samples and known variances.

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,570
Therefore we can use the Z statistic.

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,490
I hope you are getting the point.

30
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,720
Small samples and unknown variances mean t.

31
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,770
When we have large samples and unknown variances.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,360
It is up to the researcher but generally it is OK to use z in that case as well.

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,880
All right here's the formula for the test stick cystic sample difference mean minus hypothesized difference

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,630
mean divided by the standard error.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,440
We plug in the numbers and get a z score of minus 2.4 for let's calculate the p value once again I'll

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,810
just tell you the p value.

37
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,020
As usually you will obtain it using a software.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,800
The p value of the two sided test is 0.01 5.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,390
We can say at 5 percent significance which is common for such a study.

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,220
The p value of zero point zero 1 5 is lower than 0.05.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,320
Thus we reject the null hypothesis.

42
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,340
There is enough statistical evidence that the difference of the two means is not 4 percent.

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,990
Alright cool.

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:00,360
Here's a trick What if you want to know if the difference is higher or lower than for the sign of the

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,920
test tested mistake can give you that information.

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,060
A minus sign of the tested tested means it's smaller if you reverse engineered the standardization process

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,360
you will find that the true value is likely to be lower than the hypothesized value.

48
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,510
In our case this translates into the true mean is likely to be lower than minus for lower than minus

49
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,760
for entails that possible values are minus 5 minus 6 and so on.

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,280
This is additional information you can give to the Dean.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,050
All right.

52
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,630
Done with that lesson too.

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,860
Let's proceed to the final topic.

54
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,620
Independent samples and unknown variances.

00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,850
Know we know how to test hypotheses and how to reject them.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,110
Actually we rejected the hypothesis at various levels of significance but we couldn't find a level of

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,690
significance for which we could no longer do it.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,970
This is the right moment to introduce a measure called the P-value.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,820
This is the most common way to test hypotheses instead of testing at pre-assigned levels of significance.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,580
We can find the smallest level of significance at which we can still reject the null hypothesis given

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,420
the observed sample statistic.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,390
So how do we do that.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,220
Recall the test with the data scientists salary.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,380
We had a standard error of two thousand seven hundred thirty nine known population standard deviation

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,300
of 15000 normally distributed population and a sample size of 30 the corresponding z score was minus

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,270
4.6 7.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,650
We rejected the hypothesis at significant levels of 0.05 and 0.01.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,510
But we wanted to know how much lower we could go.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:12,150
We can check the Z table for plus 4.6 7 which gives us the same result as minus 4.6 7 in most Z tables.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,110
You would not find this value as it is so large.

17
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:22,020
Thus we round up to the Close's value available and get 0.00 0 1 way.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,540
But how do we actually test the hypothesis.

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,860
Well after choosing a significance level of alpha you compare the P-value to it.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,560
You should reject the hypothesis if the p value is lower than the significance level.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,780
Therefore we can safely say that such a result is extremely significant by any measurement of significance.

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:51,230
Let's see another example if ours the score was 2.1 2 we would reject the no hypothesis at 5 percent

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,950
but not reject it at 1 percent significance.

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,820
Now it becomes more interesting at this point we can actually look at the table and then find the P-value

25
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,990
we look for the value that corresponds with 2.1 to and find that it is zero point 983 the p value for

26
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,850
a one sided test is 1 minus the number we see in the table.

27
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:22,710
So the corresponding p value is equal to zero point zero 1 7 the p value for a two sided test is 1 minus

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,890
the number we see in the table multiplied by 2.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,010
Therefore the p value would be zero point zero three four.

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,460
This is also the answer to our question.

31
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,980
All right so where are the values used most testicle software packages run tests and then provide us

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:46,640
with a series of results one of them is P-value it is then up to the researcher to decide whether the

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,560
variable is statistically significant or not.

34
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,420
Generally software is designed to calculate the p value to the third digit after the separator.

35
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,610
The point is when you start conducting your own research you would love to be able to see the three

36
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,780
zeros after the dot.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,780
The closer to 0 Your p value is the more significant is the result you've obtained.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,370
The final consideration is that the p value is an extremely powerful measure as it works for all distributions

39
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:23,180
no matter if we are dealing with the normal Student's t by Gnomeo or uniform distribution.

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,280
Whatever the test the P-value rationale holds if the p value is lower than the level of significance

41
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,340
you reject the null hypothesis.

42
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,570
Having said that you would normally use the p value in the presence of a digital medium throughout this

43
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,260
course.

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,690
I recommend that you use online P-value calculators to support your studies and double check your answers

45
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,640
when doing exercises.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,500
Please download the PTF that comes with this lesson as it will include detailed instructions for how

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,570
to use online P-value calculators.

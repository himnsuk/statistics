00:00.760 --> 00:01.420
All right.

00:01.540 --> 00:02.650
Great.

00:02.650 --> 00:08.530
Now that we know what the value is and how to use it we will give back to hypothesis testing.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.380
We saw only one of the two possible cases.

00:11.380 --> 00:18.120
Remember we haven't covered the more commonly observed case when the population variance is unknown.

00:18.130 --> 00:18.970
All right.

00:18.970 --> 00:24.310
Imagine you are the marketing analyst of a company and you've been asked to estimate if the e-mail open

00:24.310 --> 00:28.240
rate of one of the firm's competitors is above your company's.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.640
Your company has an open rate of 40 percent an email open rate is a measure of how many people on the

00:34.640 --> 00:38.070
e-mail list actually open the e-mails they have received.

00:38.230 --> 00:43.600
At first you struggled to figure out how to get such specific information about a competitor company

00:43.780 --> 00:50.170
but then you see that an employee of that competitor company posted a selfie on Facebook saying oh well

00:50.320 --> 00:55.060
the e-mail management software we are using drives me nuts in the background.

00:55.090 --> 01:00.460
You can see her screen and it shows clearly the summaries of the last 10 email campaigns that were sent

01:00.580 --> 01:02.720
and their corresponding open rates.

01:02.890 --> 01:06.780
Bingo with your statistical skills.

01:06.870 --> 01:10.560
That's all you need a little help from Facebook.

01:10.700 --> 01:18.680
Let's stay the hypotheses no hypothesis mean open rate is lower or equal to 40 percent.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.230
Alternative Hypothesis mean open rate is higher than 40 percent.

01:24.140 --> 01:24.570
No.

01:24.590 --> 01:31.100
That in hypothesis testing we are aiming to reject the no hypothesis when we want to test if the open

01:31.100 --> 01:32.860
rate is higher than 40 percent.

01:32.870 --> 01:36.540
The null hypothesis actually states the opposite statement.

01:36.830 --> 01:42.200
Also pay attention that this time we're dealing with a one sided test.

01:42.200 --> 01:42.930
All right.

01:42.940 --> 01:48.030
Your boss told you that 0.05 is an adequate significance level for this test.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.500
So that's what you'll use.

01:49.750 --> 01:56.210
Here's the data set you calculate the sample mean and get thirty seven point seven percent.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.480
The sample standard deviation is thirteen point seventy four percent.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.840
Thus the standard error is 1.3 7 percent.

02:04.860 --> 02:10.650
You assume that the population of open rates of sent e-mails is normally distributed like confidence

02:10.650 --> 02:13.440
intervals with variants are known and a small sample.

02:13.470 --> 02:17.280
The correct statistic to use is the t statistic.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.780
Remember you do not know the variance and the sample is not big enough.

02:21.780 --> 02:27.760
This means that the variable follows the Student's t distribution and you must employ the t statistic

02:28.790 --> 02:36.230
let's calculate it then we calculate the T score the same way as the Z score the T score is equal to

02:36.230 --> 02:42.140
the sample mean minus the hypothesized mean value divided by the standard error.

02:42.140 --> 02:50.090
The result that we get is minus 1.6 7 as we said earlier is easier to work with positive numbers so

02:50.090 --> 02:56.480
we should compare the absolute value of minus 1.6 7 with the appropriate t with and minus 1 degrees

02:56.480 --> 03:01.160
of freedom at 0.05 one sided significance.

03:01.160 --> 03:06.830
We quickly navigate through the table and get 1.8 three at the 5 percent significance critical value

03:08.280 --> 03:13.270
OK 1.6 7 is lower than 1.8 3.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.890
Remember the decision rule.

03:15.030 --> 03:20.430
If the absolute value of the T score is lower than the statistic from the table we cannot reject the

03:20.430 --> 03:22.050
no hypothesis.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.650
Therefore we must accept it.

03:24.660 --> 03:31.260
What you do next is you go and tell your boss that at this level of significance statistically we cannot

03:31.260 --> 03:36.350
say that the evil open rate of our competitors is higher than 40 percent.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.910
What about the second measurement we saw.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.080
What was that.

03:40.380 --> 03:49.890
Ah yes the p value the p value of this statistic is 0.06 5 as the p value is greater than the significance

03:49.890 --> 03:51.670
level of 0.05.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.670
We come to the same conclusion.

03:53.730 --> 03:57.260
We cannot reject the null hypothesis.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.580
Let's do a quick check if the significance level was zero point zero or one the p value would still

04:03.580 --> 04:07.110
be higher and we wouldn't reject the null hypothesis.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.340
This is an important observation that we haven't noted before.

04:10.570 --> 04:18.200
If we cannot reject a test at 0.05 significance we cannot reject it at smaller levels either.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.340
All right that's all for now.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.180
Make sure you learn the material by doing the exercises.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.860
After this lesson.

04:24.860 --> 04:25.980
Thanks for watching.

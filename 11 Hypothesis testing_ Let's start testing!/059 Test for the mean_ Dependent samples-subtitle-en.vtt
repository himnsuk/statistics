00:00.420 --> 00:06.360
We are not done with Hypothesis Testing just yet remember how we started with confidence intervals for

00:06.360 --> 00:11.320
a single population mean and then switched to examples considering multiple populations.

00:11.520 --> 00:18.750
While we are in the same situation here single populations are just the beginning time to do multiple

00:18.750 --> 00:19.960
means.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.010
We will start with dependent samples.

00:23.010 --> 00:28.260
The most intuitive examples of dependent samples are the ones you have been through like weight loss

00:28.320 --> 00:29.960
and blood tests.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.440
The sample is drawn from Weight-Loss data or concentration of nutrient data.

00:34.560 --> 00:41.780
But the subject of interest is the same person before and after OK let's get to work.

00:41.780 --> 00:45.480
Do you recall our example with the magnesium levels in one's blood.

00:45.710 --> 00:52.670
There was this drug company developing a new pill that supposably increased levels of magnesium of recipients.

00:52.670 --> 00:57.530
There were 10 people involved in the study that were taking the drug for some time and we calculated

00:57.530 --> 01:01.470
confidence intervals that helped us study the effects of that drug.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.640
They indicated the range of plausible values for the population mean.

01:05.750 --> 01:11.960
This time we want to come to a single definite conclusion about the effectiveness of the drug.

01:11.960 --> 01:12.560
All right.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.230
Let's state the no hypothesis.

01:15.260 --> 01:22.010
The population mean before is greater or equal than the population mean after the alternative is that

01:22.010 --> 01:26.210
the population mean before is lower than the one after.

01:26.210 --> 01:30.980
Once again we want to know if the magnesium levels are higher.

01:30.980 --> 01:36.530
We construct a no and alternative hypotheses in such a way so that we are aiming to reject the null

01:36.530 --> 01:38.060
hypothesis.

01:38.060 --> 01:40.300
OK let's reorder a bit.

01:40.310 --> 01:48.340
Age 0 is myu before which is equal or higher than mu after this is equivalent to MMU before minus myu

01:48.350 --> 01:51.710
after is equal to zero or positive.

01:51.710 --> 01:58.480
We can substitute this with capital D 0 it stands for the hypothesized population mean difference.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.710
So we restate our hypotheses using d for simplicity.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.230
Now we have our test designed.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.920
Let's crunch some numbers.

02:07.940 --> 02:09.720
Here's the data set.

02:09.950 --> 02:14.390
We have 10 observations people have registered before and after.

02:14.390 --> 02:21.050
Naturally the difference is equal to before minus after we can calculate the sample mean of the difference

02:21.590 --> 02:24.310
we get minus 0.3 3.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.730
The sample standard deviation is zero point four or five.

02:27.830 --> 02:35.570
And the standard error is 0.1 for the appropriate statistic to use here is the t statistic.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.040
We have a small sample.

02:37.120 --> 02:42.130
We assume normal distribution of the population and we don't know the variance.

02:42.230 --> 02:47.000
So the score is equal to the following expression.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.530
Now we can simply carry up the calculations and find that its value is minus 2.2 none since we don't

02:54.530 --> 02:56.620
want to choose a level of significance.

02:56.690 --> 03:02.270
Well solve the problem with the P-value in order to find the value of this one sided test.

03:02.270 --> 03:08.930
We may go to the table and see it is somewhere between zero point zero one and zero point zero to five.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.060
As I told you earlier using software is much easier.

03:13.070 --> 03:20.280
So after using an online P-value calculator I can tell you that it is exactly zero point zero to four.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.560
What was that decision rule again.

03:22.610 --> 03:26.330
If the p value is lower than the significance level we are interested in.

03:26.330 --> 03:29.000
We reject the no hypothesis.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.530
OK so if the level of significance is 0.05 and the p value is lower we will be able to reject the hypothesis

03:36.590 --> 03:43.510
at 5 percent if the level of significance is zero point zero one however the p value is higher.

03:43.590 --> 03:48.470
So we cannot reject the no hypothesis at a 1 percent level of significance.

03:48.780 --> 03:56.530
The lowest value for which we can reject it is zero point zero to four which is exactly the p value.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.320
What does this tell us.

03:58.320 --> 04:04.290
Well it is up to the researcher to choose the level of significance in the case of the magnesium pill.

04:04.470 --> 04:09.840
We expect that the researcher will be very cautious as he would want to know if this is an effective

04:09.840 --> 04:13.160
pill they will be able to actually help people.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.540
If we cannot say that the pill works at a 1 percent significance level perhaps it is better to take

04:18.540 --> 04:24.780
it back to the laboratory and alternative would be to test again and increase the sample size for better

04:24.780 --> 04:25.750
results.

04:26.040 --> 04:31.740
A sample of 100 people would improve the level of precision significantly.

04:31.830 --> 04:37.560
All right so we've done some more hypothesis testing and we've explored some factors that help you determine

04:37.560 --> 04:40.050
the significance level of the test.

04:40.110 --> 04:44.850
Stay with us for our next lesson where we will learn how to test independent samples.

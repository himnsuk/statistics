00:00.530 --> 00:03.170
This is the final lesson we'll do on testing.

00:03.290 --> 00:08.870
The last case we'll examine is the one with independent samples and unknown variances which are assumed

00:08.870 --> 00:10.200
to be equal.

00:10.280 --> 00:14.730
I'll quickly brush up your memory on the data set we did in the confidence interval section.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.510
You were trying to see if apples in New York are as expensive as the ones in L.A. You went to 10 grocery

00:20.510 --> 00:26.210
shops in New York and your friend Paul who lives in L.A. went to eight grocery shops there you got all

00:26.210 --> 00:28.640
the prices and put them in a table.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.590
You didn't know the population variance of the Apple prices but you assumed it should be the same for

00:33.590 --> 00:42.730
New York and L.A. red state the no and alternative hypotheses age zero myu in NY is equal to you in

00:42.730 --> 00:46.820
L.A. or myu and y minus myu L.A. is equal to zero.

00:47.570 --> 00:55.410
H-1 new in NY differs from you in L.A. or me and why minus L.A. differs from zero.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.090
All right.

00:56.210 --> 00:57.740
That's our data set.

00:57.740 --> 01:04.100
We have also calculated the sample means standard deviations and sample sizes what can we do when the

01:04.100 --> 01:06.920
variance is unknown but assumed to be equal.

01:07.310 --> 01:10.260
Earlier we used the pooled variance formula.

01:10.490 --> 01:12.540
Well here it is again.

01:12.650 --> 01:16.820
Remember all right it's all about plugging in numbers.

01:16.850 --> 01:18.760
So I'll save you the trouble.

01:18.980 --> 01:22.250
The pooled variance is 0.05.

01:22.310 --> 01:27.590
One last thing we need is the standard error of the difference of means it is given by the following

01:27.590 --> 01:28.830
formula.

01:28.850 --> 01:32.800
I am going faster than usual as we have seen all of this before.

01:32.810 --> 01:37.670
Moreover testing is about understanding computation is routine.

01:37.790 --> 01:43.460
So let's start testing shall we small samples variance unknown.

01:43.550 --> 01:46.800
Which statistic do we need exactly.

01:46.820 --> 01:48.870
It's the statistic again.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.960
How many degrees of freedom.

01:51.140 --> 01:56.560
You may recall it from earlier it was the combined sample size minus the number of variables.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.380
So 10 plus eight minus two which gives a 16.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.980
Let's see the t statistic formula.

02:03.110 --> 02:08.720
Once again the difference between simple means minus the difference between hypothesized true means

02:08.870 --> 02:16.290
divided by the standard error after plugging in everything we get a tested mistake of 6.5 3.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.490
Do we need to compare it.

02:18.540 --> 02:23.130
This is by far the most extreme testing stick we have seen.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.570
You will have a hard time finding it in the table for common tests.

02:27.570 --> 02:32.510
A rule of thumb is to reject the null hypothesis when the score is bigger than 2.

02:32.670 --> 02:39.230
Generally for z score and score a value higher than 4 is extremely significant.

02:39.240 --> 02:47.160
Let's see the two sided P-value the p value of this test is lower than 0.00 0 somewhere around zero

02:47.160 --> 02:49.760
point 0 0 0 0 0 1.

02:50.040 --> 02:56.540
In our lesson about p value we said researchers are always looking for those three zeros after the dot.

02:56.580 --> 03:02.340
It means the test is extremely significant and the probability of making a type 1 error is virtually

03:02.340 --> 03:03.460
zero.

03:03.480 --> 03:09.380
Therefore we reject the null hypothesis at all common and uncommon levels of significance.

03:09.420 --> 03:15.810
There is strong statistical evidence that the price of apples in New York differs from an L.A. but such

03:15.810 --> 03:22.020
an extreme result may also mean the hypothesis is pointless or poorly designed from the mean values

03:22.020 --> 03:24.670
of 3.9 four and three point to five.

03:24.690 --> 03:30.420
And with such small and closed standard deviations of around 0.2 we could easily say the prices are

03:30.420 --> 03:31.080
different.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.880
No testing needed.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.160
A much more interesting question would be if the price of apples in New York is 20 percent higher than

03:38.160 --> 03:39.190
in L.A..

03:39.360 --> 03:41.770
I will leave you this exercise for homework.

03:42.630 --> 03:43.400
All right.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.050
We're done with hypothesis testing.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.800
Cheers and thanks for watching.

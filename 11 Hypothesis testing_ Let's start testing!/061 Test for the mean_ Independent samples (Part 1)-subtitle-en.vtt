00:00.850 --> 00:06.430
High again as you probably expected in this lesson we will learn about independent samples with known

00:06.430 --> 00:07.470
variants.

00:07.640 --> 00:13.630
Once get into the example you may remember this one we are about to test the average grades of students

00:13.630 --> 00:16.300
from two departments in a UK university.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.310
I would like to remind you that in the UK grades are expressed in percentages.

00:21.310 --> 00:24.490
The two departments are engineering and management.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.040
We were told by the Dean that engineering is a tougher discipline and people tend to get lower grades.

00:30.040 --> 00:36.700
He believes that on average management students outperform engineering students by four percentage points.

00:36.730 --> 00:40.450
Now it is our job to verify if that is the case.

00:40.480 --> 00:47.940
Let's state the two hypotheses age zero is the difference between the means of the two populations is

00:47.940 --> 00:50.190
for or stated differently.

00:50.190 --> 00:54.750
New engineering minus new management is equal to minus four.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.510
H1 is the population mean.

00:57.510 --> 01:00.940
Difference is different than minus for.

01:00.950 --> 01:03.970
Once again this is a two sided test.

01:04.040 --> 01:11.550
Our research question is not to find the difference but to check if it is exactly the minus for right.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.580
Let's get our hands dirty.

01:13.810 --> 01:16.250
Here's the table that summarizes the data.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.820
The sample sizes are 170 respectively.

01:19.900 --> 01:26.080
The sample means are 58 percent and 65 percent and the population standard deviations are 10 percent

01:26.110 --> 01:29.100
and 6 percent and are known from the past data.

01:29.110 --> 01:34.510
If you remember when the population is known for independent samples the standard error of the difference

01:34.570 --> 01:40.060
is equal to the square root of the sum of the variance of engineering divided by its simple size and

01:40.060 --> 01:41.570
the variance of management.

01:41.620 --> 01:44.530
Again divided by sample size.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.830
All we have left is to compute the test autistic.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.770
We have big samples and known variances.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.570
Therefore we can use the Z statistic.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.490
I hope you are getting the point.

01:56.490 --> 01:59.720
Small samples and unknown variances mean t.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.770
When we have large samples and unknown variances.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.360
It is up to the researcher but generally it is OK to use z in that case as well.

02:08.370 --> 02:14.880
All right here's the formula for the test stick cystic sample difference mean minus hypothesized difference

02:14.880 --> 02:17.630
mean divided by the standard error.

02:17.910 --> 02:25.440
We plug in the numbers and get a z score of minus 2.4 for let's calculate the p value once again I'll

02:25.440 --> 02:26.810
just tell you the p value.

02:26.910 --> 02:30.020
As usually you will obtain it using a software.

02:30.180 --> 02:34.800
The p value of the two sided test is 0.01 5.

02:34.980 --> 02:39.390
We can say at 5 percent significance which is common for such a study.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.220
The p value of zero point zero 1 5 is lower than 0.05.

02:44.340 --> 02:47.320
Thus we reject the null hypothesis.

02:47.370 --> 02:52.340
There is enough statistical evidence that the difference of the two means is not 4 percent.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.990
Alright cool.

02:54.210 --> 03:00.360
Here's a trick What if you want to know if the difference is higher or lower than for the sign of the

03:00.360 --> 03:02.920
test tested mistake can give you that information.

03:03.150 --> 03:09.060
A minus sign of the tested tested means it's smaller if you reverse engineered the standardization process

03:09.170 --> 03:14.360
you will find that the true value is likely to be lower than the hypothesized value.

03:14.490 --> 03:21.510
In our case this translates into the true mean is likely to be lower than minus for lower than minus

03:21.510 --> 03:26.760
for entails that possible values are minus 5 minus 6 and so on.

03:26.820 --> 03:30.280
This is additional information you can give to the Dean.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.050
All right.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.630
Done with that lesson too.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.860
Let's proceed to the final topic.

03:34.950 --> 03:37.620
Independent samples and unknown variances.

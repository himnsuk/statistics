00:00.380 --> 00:03.850
Know we know how to test hypotheses and how to reject them.

00:04.260 --> 00:10.110
Actually we rejected the hypothesis at various levels of significance but we couldn't find a level of

00:10.110 --> 00:12.690
significance for which we could no longer do it.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.970
This is the right moment to introduce a measure called the P-value.

00:17.040 --> 00:23.820
This is the most common way to test hypotheses instead of testing at pre-assigned levels of significance.

00:23.850 --> 00:29.580
We can find the smallest level of significance at which we can still reject the null hypothesis given

00:29.580 --> 00:32.420
the observed sample statistic.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.390
So how do we do that.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.220
Recall the test with the data scientists salary.

00:37.470 --> 00:43.380
We had a standard error of two thousand seven hundred thirty nine known population standard deviation

00:43.440 --> 00:51.300
of 15000 normally distributed population and a sample size of 30 the corresponding z score was minus

00:51.300 --> 00:53.270
4.6 7.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.650
We rejected the hypothesis at significant levels of 0.05 and 0.01.

00:59.790 --> 01:03.510
But we wanted to know how much lower we could go.

01:03.580 --> 01:12.150
We can check the Z table for plus 4.6 7 which gives us the same result as minus 4.6 7 in most Z tables.

01:12.220 --> 01:15.110
You would not find this value as it is so large.

01:15.130 --> 01:22.020
Thus we round up to the Close's value available and get 0.00 0 1 way.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.540
But how do we actually test the hypothesis.

01:25.580 --> 01:30.860
Well after choosing a significance level of alpha you compare the P-value to it.

01:30.980 --> 01:36.560
You should reject the hypothesis if the p value is lower than the significance level.

01:36.560 --> 01:42.780
Therefore we can safely say that such a result is extremely significant by any measurement of significance.

01:43.940 --> 01:51.230
Let's see another example if ours the score was 2.1 2 we would reject the no hypothesis at 5 percent

01:51.350 --> 01:54.950
but not reject it at 1 percent significance.

01:54.950 --> 02:01.820
Now it becomes more interesting at this point we can actually look at the table and then find the P-value

02:02.450 --> 02:09.990
we look for the value that corresponds with 2.1 to and find that it is zero point 983 the p value for

02:09.990 --> 02:13.850
a one sided test is 1 minus the number we see in the table.

02:14.010 --> 02:22.710
So the corresponding p value is equal to zero point zero 1 7 the p value for a two sided test is 1 minus

02:22.710 --> 02:25.890
the number we see in the table multiplied by 2.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.010
Therefore the p value would be zero point zero three four.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.460
This is also the answer to our question.

02:33.380 --> 02:39.980
All right so where are the values used most testicle software packages run tests and then provide us

02:39.980 --> 02:46.640
with a series of results one of them is P-value it is then up to the researcher to decide whether the

02:46.640 --> 02:49.560
variable is statistically significant or not.

02:49.910 --> 02:56.420
Generally software is designed to calculate the p value to the third digit after the separator.

02:56.420 --> 03:01.610
The point is when you start conducting your own research you would love to be able to see the three

03:01.610 --> 03:03.780
zeros after the dot.

03:03.920 --> 03:09.780
The closer to 0 Your p value is the more significant is the result you've obtained.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.370
The final consideration is that the p value is an extremely powerful measure as it works for all distributions

03:16.810 --> 03:23.180
no matter if we are dealing with the normal Student's t by Gnomeo or uniform distribution.

03:23.560 --> 03:30.280
Whatever the test the P-value rationale holds if the p value is lower than the level of significance

03:30.370 --> 03:33.340
you reject the null hypothesis.

03:33.360 --> 03:39.570
Having said that you would normally use the p value in the presence of a digital medium throughout this

03:39.570 --> 03:40.260
course.

03:40.260 --> 03:45.690
I recommend that you use online P-value calculators to support your studies and double check your answers

03:45.690 --> 03:47.640
when doing exercises.

03:47.640 --> 03:52.500
Please download the PTF that comes with this lesson as it will include detailed instructions for how

03:52.500 --> 03:54.570
to use online P-value calculators.

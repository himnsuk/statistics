1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,170
This is the final lesson we'll do on testing.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,870
The last case we'll examine is the one with independent samples and unknown variances which are assumed

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,200
to be equal.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,730
I'll quickly brush up your memory on the data set we did in the confidence interval section.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,510
You were trying to see if apples in New York are as expensive as the ones in L.A. You went to 10 grocery

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,210
shops in New York and your friend Paul who lives in L.A. went to eight grocery shops there you got all

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,640
the prices and put them in a table.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,590
You didn't know the population variance of the Apple prices but you assumed it should be the same for

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:42,730
New York and L.A. red state the no and alternative hypotheses age zero myu in NY is equal to you in

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,820
L.A. or myu and y minus myu L.A. is equal to zero.

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:55,410
H-1 new in NY differs from you in L.A. or me and why minus L.A. differs from zero.

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,090
All right.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,740
That's our data set.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,100
We have also calculated the sample means standard deviations and sample sizes what can we do when the

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,920
variance is unknown but assumed to be equal.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,260
Earlier we used the pooled variance formula.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,540
Well here it is again.

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,820
Remember all right it's all about plugging in numbers.

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,760
So I'll save you the trouble.

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,250
The pooled variance is 0.05.

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,590
One last thing we need is the standard error of the difference of means it is given by the following

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,830
formula.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,800
I am going faster than usual as we have seen all of this before.

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,670
Moreover testing is about understanding computation is routine.

25
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,460
So let's start testing shall we small samples variance unknown.

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,800
Which statistic do we need exactly.

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,870
It's the statistic again.

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,960
How many degrees of freedom.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,560
You may recall it from earlier it was the combined sample size minus the number of variables.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,380
So 10 plus eight minus two which gives a 16.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's see the t statistic formula.

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,720
Once again the difference between simple means minus the difference between hypothesized true means

33
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:16,290
divided by the standard error after plugging in everything we get a tested mistake of 6.5 3.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,490
Do we need to compare it.

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,130
This is by far the most extreme testing stick we have seen.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,570
You will have a hard time finding it in the table for common tests.

37
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,510
A rule of thumb is to reject the null hypothesis when the score is bigger than 2.

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,230
Generally for z score and score a value higher than 4 is extremely significant.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:47,160
Let's see the two sided P-value the p value of this test is lower than 0.00 0 somewhere around zero

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,760
point 0 0 0 0 0 1.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,540
In our lesson about p value we said researchers are always looking for those three zeros after the dot.

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,340
It means the test is extremely significant and the probability of making a type 1 error is virtually

43
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,460
zero.

44
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,380
Therefore we reject the null hypothesis at all common and uncommon levels of significance.

45
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,810
There is strong statistical evidence that the price of apples in New York differs from an L.A. but such

46
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,020
an extreme result may also mean the hypothesis is pointless or poorly designed from the mean values

47
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,670
of 3.9 four and three point to five.

48
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,420
And with such small and closed standard deviations of around 0.2 we could easily say the prices are

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,080
different.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
No testing needed.

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,160
A much more interesting question would be if the price of apples in New York is 20 percent higher than

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,190
in L.A..

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,770
I will leave you this exercise for homework.

54
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,400
All right.

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,050
We're done with hypothesis testing.

56
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,800
Cheers and thanks for watching.

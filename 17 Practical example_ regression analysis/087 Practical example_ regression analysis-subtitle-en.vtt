00:01.050 --> 00:06.530
Hey if this section seems too theoretical now is the time to prove you wrong.

00:06.750 --> 00:10.310
We will deal with a real life example about car sales.

00:11.180 --> 00:17.840
Actually it is so real life that it is very messy and we will need to first clean our dataset then go

00:17.840 --> 00:21.120
through several assumptions relax them on them.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.510
Practice with the concept of log transformation.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.360
We mentioned earlier create a model and we will eventually finish off with some dummy variables.

00:30.460 --> 00:36.240
I bet you will be blown away by all the things you already know everything will be interconnected.

00:36.250 --> 00:42.010
So get comfortable and let's start analyzing heres our data set.

00:42.820 --> 00:51.190
This is a list of second hand cars with their respective price type of body mileage engine volume engine

00:51.190 --> 00:55.810
type year of production and model.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.690
What we would like to do is predict the price of a used car depending on its specifications.

01:02.740 --> 01:09.130
The first potential aggressor is brand as it is well known that a BMW is generally more expensive than

01:09.130 --> 01:11.550
a Toyota.

01:11.560 --> 01:17.560
The second relevant variable is mileage since the car is driven the cheaper it should be.

01:18.990 --> 01:27.450
Third the engine volume sports cars have larger engines and economy cars have smaller engines and the

01:27.450 --> 01:29.970
final variable is year of production.

01:29.970 --> 01:36.020
The older the car the cheaper it is with the exception of vintage vehicles.

01:36.130 --> 01:39.790
These are the variables we will focus on.

01:39.860 --> 01:40.750
All right.

01:40.750 --> 01:44.130
We haven't spoken about data cleaning so far in this course.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.050
Our focus was statistics.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.980
So I was always cleaning the data sets for you before presenting them.

01:50.080 --> 01:56.310
This time it will be different and you will get a feeling of what raw data looks like.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.390
I will go column by column.

01:58.400 --> 02:04.290
Excel is not optimized for data analysis but it has sufficient resources for our current needs.

02:05.830 --> 02:11.590
An easy way to spot problems with your data in Excel such as missing values is to sort the cells.

02:11.620 --> 02:17.670
So I'll start sorting the relevant cells brand looks fine.

02:19.350 --> 02:22.340
Price however has lots of missing values.

02:23.140 --> 02:28.000
There are different methodologies for sorting this out but I will simply remove all observations that

02:28.000 --> 02:31.650
do not include a price as price is the dependent variable.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.790
It is a big issue in our analysis.

02:33.790 --> 02:40.890
If there is no price listed a rule of thumb is that if you are removing less than 5 percent of the observations

02:40.980 --> 02:45.660
you are free to just remove all observations that have missing values.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.270
In this case they are 4.4 percent.

02:50.450 --> 02:57.630
The next variable is mileage and thousands of miles there are missing values for it as well.

02:57.680 --> 03:04.000
We are not sure if these are zeros or something else looking at the year of production and the price

03:04.060 --> 03:05.380
they most likely are.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.590
While more diligence should be applied.

03:07.660 --> 03:09.160
I'll just add zeros here.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.080
The next variable is the engine.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.060
We can see many values that are not available.

03:16.070 --> 03:24.090
It's best to delete these variables OK but then there are also the engine volume values of ninety nine

03:24.090 --> 03:28.460
point ninety nine ninety seventy five etc..

03:28.510 --> 03:32.400
I am no car expert but these are not usual values.

03:32.410 --> 03:39.340
Moreover looking through all 4000 plus values we noticed that most entries are in the range from 0.6

03:39.340 --> 03:41.470
to 6.5.

03:41.470 --> 03:46.700
A quick search on Google would confirm that's the interval where engine volume should fall.

03:46.720 --> 03:54.290
Therefore those ninety nine point ninety nine 90s and so on are incorrect entries actually a common

03:54.290 --> 03:58.270
way to label missing values is by assigning ninety nine point ninety nine.

03:58.310 --> 04:01.760
That's something that's stuck from the early ages of computers.

04:01.790 --> 04:08.150
It is a bad idea to label values in such ways as it is very hard for other users of the data to distinguish

04:08.150 --> 04:10.490
them from the true values.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.650
However be aware that some people still do it.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.500
Let's remove these entries.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.700
The last value of interest is the year when a car was produced.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.160
There are no problems with it.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.240
We're good to go.

04:26.250 --> 04:33.690
All right so far we have identified brand mileage engine volume and year of production as regressors

04:34.830 --> 04:37.230
brand is categorical data.

04:37.230 --> 04:42.390
Linearity is not going to be an issue there as the brand will be included in the regression through

04:42.390 --> 04:43.690
dummy variables.

04:45.220 --> 04:51.900
We are left with price mileage and year where price is the dependent variable of the regression.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.660
Let's check for linearity using a scatterplot.

04:55.700 --> 05:02.140
These are the three scatter plots that we obtain one for a price and mileage one for price and year

05:02.230 --> 05:05.090
and one for price and engine volume.

05:05.260 --> 05:12.010
We can spot patterns but definitely not linear ones projected by Excel with the orange trend line.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.560
We know we should not run a linear regression in this case.

05:15.600 --> 05:23.240
We should first transform one or more variables as I have told you before log transformation is a common

05:23.240 --> 05:25.150
way of dealing with this issue.

05:25.160 --> 05:30.250
It is especially useful when facing exponential scatterplot like we do now.

05:30.450 --> 05:33.540
Let's take the log of prices and plot them again.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.390
All right.

05:44.390 --> 05:46.610
We can see a linear pattern in the plots.

05:46.610 --> 05:50.580
Now the lines fit the data so much better.

05:50.650 --> 05:56.560
However I'd like to take the log of mileage and do a log log scatterplot as I suspect that we will get

05:56.560 --> 05:58.050
even better results.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.820
Ok I was kind of wrong.

06:07.990 --> 06:14.050
It is hard to say if this is an improvement but let's keep the log of mileage in the regression as to

06:14.050 --> 06:19.710
see how is a log log relationship interpreted superb.

06:19.770 --> 06:23.600
Next we have to deal with the no endogenous assumption.

06:23.640 --> 06:29.280
There are tests to check if it is violated or one can take the residuals and find their correlation

06:29.280 --> 06:31.760
with each independent x.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.530
I can tell you that the assumption is not violated.

06:34.590 --> 06:37.820
So it is of no interest.

06:37.870 --> 06:40.400
The third assumption had several parts.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.070
Normality is assumed for a big sample following the Central Limit Theorem.

06:45.190 --> 06:50.230
The zero mean of the distribution of errors is accomplished through the inclusions of the intercept

06:50.230 --> 06:57.810
in the regression finally the homeless get STC the assumption generally holds as we can see in the graphs.

06:58.220 --> 07:03.470
The reason for that is that we already implemented a log transformation which is the most common fix

07:03.470 --> 07:06.650
for hetero's cadets Tisci.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.880
The fourth assumption is no autocorrelation.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.470
We don't really need to put much effort into that.

07:12.520 --> 07:17.560
The observations we have are not coming from time series data or Pennel data.

07:17.770 --> 07:22.980
They are simply a snapshot of the current situation at a second hand car sales website.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.910
Each row comes from a different customer who is willing to sell their car through the platform.

07:27.910 --> 07:32.920
Logically there is no reason for the observations to be dependent on each other.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.520
We are safe.

07:35.620 --> 07:42.760
Finally we should check for multi-collinearity that can be done by finding the correlations of all possible

07:42.760 --> 07:50.420
pairs of variables mileage with your mileage with engine volume and year with engine volume.

07:50.440 --> 07:57.910
The correlations are far from strong so we can conclude that we are not in the presence of multi-collinearity.

07:58.150 --> 08:03.580
After having checked the assumptions we can finally create the regression.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.100
First let's explain the log price with log mileage.

08:07.470 --> 08:11.080
OK we can see that the model is significant.

08:11.130 --> 08:17.460
The explanatory variable is significant too and the R-squared of the regression is 0.27.

08:17.460 --> 08:22.520
So we have some explanatory power but this is not a very powerful model.

08:24.740 --> 08:25.780
Similarily.

08:25.880 --> 08:34.280
The R-squared of a regression of price with engine volume is zero point to one next let's explain log

08:34.300 --> 08:44.540
price with year both the model and the variable are significant the R-Squared is 0.5 6 so year explains

08:44.540 --> 08:47.900
56 percent of the variability of a car's price.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.880
That's a remarkable relationship.

08:51.890 --> 08:58.940
Now let's create a regression using all three variables mileage year and engine volume.

08:59.140 --> 09:02.230
The model and all variables are significant.

09:02.230 --> 09:06.580
We already expected that given that we created three regressions earlier.

09:06.640 --> 09:15.690
However this time the adjusted R-squared is 0.7 7 therefore the three variables together explain 77

09:15.690 --> 09:18.320
percent of the total variability.

09:18.480 --> 09:25.950
That's a very nice and rigid model already to conclude the example we would like to include the brand

09:25.950 --> 09:27.570
in the regression.

09:27.690 --> 09:36.250
There are seven brands Audi BMW Mercedes Mitsubishi Renault Toyota and Volkswagen.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.150
This is categorical data.

09:38.340 --> 09:44.710
In order to be included in the regression we have to create dummy variables already dummy would be one

09:44.740 --> 09:52.990
if the brand is Audi and 0 if it is not BMW dummy would be one if the brand is BMW and 0 if it is not.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.900
And so on for the last brand.

09:55.930 --> 10:00.310
In this case Volkswagen we will not create a dummy variable.

10:00.310 --> 10:02.120
The reasoning is the following.

10:02.200 --> 10:09.540
If all other dummy variables are 0 it is clear that the car is Volkswagen if we include a separate variable

10:09.540 --> 10:10.820
called Volkswagen.

10:10.890 --> 10:16.680
We will introduce multi-collinearity to the regression the Volkswagen dummy would be perfectly determined

10:16.680 --> 10:18.790
by the other variables.

10:18.840 --> 10:25.520
Thus if we have any categories there will be only and minus one dummys.

10:25.620 --> 10:30.390
We are basically creating the dummy variables as we did in our previous lesson.

10:30.390 --> 10:39.000
Now let's run a new regression including the dummys the final model that we get is significant.

10:39.190 --> 10:42.600
Moreover each variable included is significant.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.890
The adjusted R-squared of the model is 0.8.

10:45.970 --> 10:49.120
This regression has a very high explanatory power.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.640
The only thing we have left is to interpret the result.

10:53.690 --> 11:03.140
The model is the log of price equals minus seventy eight point four one plus minus 0.1 one times log

11:03.140 --> 11:09.920
of mileage plus 0.1 four times the engine volume plus zero point zero four times the year of the car

11:09.920 --> 11:12.500
plus the dummys.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.730
Let's look at them one by one.

11:14.730 --> 11:18.720
Keep in mind that our dependent variable is the logarithm of the price.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.760
So the interpretation will be a bit different than usual

11:24.380 --> 11:33.480
the intercept is clear mileage the log of price changes by minus 0.1 one times log of mileage.

11:33.540 --> 11:40.410
As I told you in one of our previous lessons this can be interpreted in the following way for each percentage

11:40.410 --> 11:44.520
change in mileage the price decreases by 0.1 1 percent.

11:48.990 --> 11:50.310
Engine volume.

11:50.310 --> 11:57.300
The interpretation is the following for each extra unit or leader of engine volume the logarithm of

11:57.300 --> 12:01.800
price increases by 0.1 4 to see the impact on price.

12:01.830 --> 12:08.220
We have to get back to the original variable the same way multiplying and dividing are opposite operations

12:08.310 --> 12:11.660
taking the exponential and taking the log R2.

12:11.970 --> 12:21.260
There are further explanations in the course notes but bear with me log price changes by 0.1 for normal

12:21.260 --> 12:26.070
price is equal to E to the power of log price.

12:26.130 --> 12:34.190
So to get the change in price we should find the exponential of 0.1 for therefore the price would change

12:34.190 --> 12:37.820
to 1.1 5 of its original value.

12:37.820 --> 12:43.460
That is a 1.1 5 minus 1 percent increase or 15 percent.

12:43.460 --> 12:48.360
Once again please check the course notes if you need clarification of the math involved.

12:54.360 --> 13:01.860
Year of production for each additional year the price increase is by the exponential of 0.04 minus 1

13:01.860 --> 13:03.340
in percentages.

13:03.720 --> 13:10.400
That is 4 percent.

13:10.440 --> 13:19.870
Finally we have the dummys we have 6 dummys Audi BMW Mercedes Mitsubishi Renault and Toyota.

13:20.070 --> 13:25.570
We have included Volkswagen as we said that the dummy should be one less than the options.

13:25.650 --> 13:34.440
So if all dummies are know then we get this model Another fact is that if all dumpings are no then the

13:34.440 --> 13:35.310
car is not.

13:35.310 --> 13:40.750
Audi BMW Mercedes Mitsubishi Renault or Toyota.

13:40.890 --> 13:42.550
It is a Volkswagen.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.620
So actually the dummies give us a comparison with the Volkswagen car.

13:47.770 --> 13:49.050
That's the benchmark

13:53.140 --> 13:56.950
the coefficient of the Audi dummy is 0.06.

13:56.950 --> 14:05.170
Therefore all else being equal the price of an Audi is 6 percent higher than a Volkswagen price Similarily

14:05.380 --> 14:13.830
the prices of a BMW and Mercedes are 12 percent and 11 percent more than that of a Volkswagen Mitsubishi

14:13.830 --> 14:19.030
is 5 percent cheaper in a Renault is the cheapest at a 17 percent lower price.

14:19.900 --> 14:29.980
To exhaust the dummys all else equal a Toyota is 4 percent more expensive than a Volkswagen.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.270
All right.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.900
This wraps up our exercise on regression analysis.

14:34.930 --> 14:38.630
This was my favorite topic so far and I hope you had fun.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.790
See you next time.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.010
And thanks for watching.

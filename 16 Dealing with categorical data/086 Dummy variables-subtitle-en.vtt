00:01.030 --> 00:06.040
Congratulations on reaching the last lesson of our regression analysis section.

00:06.160 --> 00:12.090
Our focus here will be dummy variables apart from the offensive side of the word.

00:12.110 --> 00:17.150
There is another meaning an imitation or a copy that stands as a substitute.

00:18.240 --> 00:24.300
In regression analysis a dummy is a variable that is used to include categorical data into a regression

00:24.300 --> 00:24.930
model.

00:25.750 --> 00:33.310
So far we used only numerical data like the S.A.T. score and the GPA or the random 1 to 3 variable from

00:33.310 --> 00:34.530
the adjusted R-squared.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.980
Lesson.

00:36.160 --> 00:41.840
Now we will explore how to include variables such as gender season and Brind into a regression we are

00:41.840 --> 00:44.500
working with.

00:44.520 --> 00:51.680
For instance let's take our GPA prediction example that we all know so very well generally.

00:51.710 --> 00:56.740
Another good and suitable regress are for GPA is attendance.

00:56.790 --> 01:02.100
Here is a data set that includes a variable that measures if a student attended more than 75 percent

01:02.100 --> 01:03.950
of their university lecturers.

01:03.960 --> 01:11.270
This is categorical data so we cannot simply put it in the regression our approach for this lesson will

01:11.270 --> 01:15.300
be to go through the process of using a dummy and explain it later on.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.350
OK here we go.

01:18.390 --> 01:22.590
Let's include another column that is called Dummy attendance.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.440
That is our dummy variable.

01:25.540 --> 01:31.810
If the student attended more than 75 percent of the lessons the dummy will be equal to 1 otherwise it

01:31.810 --> 01:33.840
will be a zero.

01:33.850 --> 01:38.560
So we have transformed our Yes or no question into ones and zeros.

01:38.740 --> 01:41.050
That's what the dummy name stands for.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.880
We're imitating the categories with numbers.

01:44.990 --> 01:45.750
All right.

01:45.810 --> 01:51.890
I don't need the original attendance variable anymore as the dummy contains the same information.

01:51.920 --> 01:58.200
Let's create a regression that explains the GPA with both S.A.T. scores and attendance.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.030
The result is the following.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.660
Our overall model is significant.

02:05.690 --> 02:12.940
The SAT score is significant and the dummy is significant although barely So the adjusted R-squared

02:12.940 --> 02:19.990
of this model is 0.4 to two which is an improvement from the 0.3 9:09 we got last time without attendance

02:21.010 --> 02:23.750
that's not game changing but is still relevant.

02:24.840 --> 02:32.550
The original model without the dummy variable was GPA equals zero point for eight plus 0.00 one five

02:32.550 --> 02:35.770
times the S.A.T. score of a student.

02:35.960 --> 02:44.120
The model including the dummy variable is GPA equals zero point eighty seven plus 0.00 1 3 times the

02:44.120 --> 02:50.770
S.A.T. score of a student plus zero point 1 1 8 4 times the dummy.

02:50.810 --> 02:53.760
Now we said that the dummy is 1 or 0.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.800
So we can actually represent this equation with two others.

02:58.530 --> 03:01.740
If the student did not attend the dummy will be zero.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.920
So Zero Point 1 1 8 4 times 0 0.

03:05.040 --> 03:11.060
The model becomes GPA equal seven plus 0.00 1 three times.

03:11.110 --> 03:16.650
S.A. if the student attended the dummy will be one.

03:16.670 --> 03:28.470
So the model becomes GPA equals zero point seven plus 0.00 1 3 times as 80 plus 0.1 1 8 for let's add

03:28.470 --> 03:36.500
the intercept and the dummy together we get GPA equals zero point nine nine plus zero point zero zero

03:36.510 --> 03:40.780
one three times S.A.T. graphically.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.490
This looks in the following way.

03:44.300 --> 03:49.130
So we have two models that have the same slope but they have a different intercept.

03:49.130 --> 03:52.200
The students who attended are spread around the upper line.

03:52.340 --> 03:58.850
On average their GPA is 0.1 one 8:4 higher than the GPA of students who did not attend

04:02.810 --> 04:05.670
OK to use this model for prediction.

04:05.720 --> 04:11.690
We need two pieces of information and S.A.T. score and the information whether a person attended more

04:11.690 --> 04:14.000
than 75 percent of their lectures.

04:15.090 --> 04:22.170
For example Joshua got hundred on his S.A.T. and did not attend 75 percent of his lessons.

04:23.020 --> 04:30.170
Our model predicts that his graduation GPA will be three point zero eight Jennifer.

04:30.190 --> 04:37.000
On the other hand got 670 on the S.A.T. but attended all of her lectures according to our regression.

04:37.030 --> 04:45.350
She is expected to graduate with 3.1 6 as you can see although she scored lower on the S.A.T..

04:45.350 --> 04:49.390
Her attendance turned things around for her.

04:49.430 --> 04:55.010
Had we used our previous model with the dummy variable we would have predicted that Joshua would graduate

04:55.010 --> 04:58.730
with three point zero or three and Jenny with 2.9 nine.

04:58.910 --> 05:04.580
While Joshua's GPA barely changed we see a significant difference in the prediction about Jenny

05:07.080 --> 05:10.300
OK this will do in our next lesson.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.500
We will solve a practical example.

05:12.570 --> 05:18.120
We will even use several dummy variables which will ensure you will reinforce what you've learned here.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.170
See you next time.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.380
And thanks for watching.

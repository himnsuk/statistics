00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,040
Congratulations on reaching the last lesson of our regression analysis section.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,090
Our focus here will be dummy variables apart from the offensive side of the word.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,150
There is another meaning an imitation or a copy that stands as a substitute.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,300
In regression analysis a dummy is a variable that is used to include categorical data into a regression

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,930
model.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:33,310
So far we used only numerical data like the S.A.T. score and the GPA or the random 1 to 3 variable from

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,530
the adjusted R-squared.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,980
Lesson.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,840
Now we will explore how to include variables such as gender season and Brind into a regression we are

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,500
working with.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,680
For instance let's take our GPA prediction example that we all know so very well generally.

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,740
Another good and suitable regress are for GPA is attendance.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,100
Here is a data set that includes a variable that measures if a student attended more than 75 percent

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,950
of their university lecturers.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,270
This is categorical data so we cannot simply put it in the regression our approach for this lesson will

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,300
be to go through the process of using a dummy and explain it later on.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,350
OK here we go.

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,590
Let's include another column that is called Dummy attendance.

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,440
That is our dummy variable.

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,810
If the student attended more than 75 percent of the lessons the dummy will be equal to 1 otherwise it

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,840
will be a zero.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,560
So we have transformed our Yes or no question into ones and zeros.

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,050
That's what the dummy name stands for.

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,880
We're imitating the categories with numbers.

25
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,750
All right.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,890
I don't need the original attendance variable anymore as the dummy contains the same information.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Let's create a regression that explains the GPA with both S.A.T. scores and attendance.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,030
The result is the following.

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,660
Our overall model is significant.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,940
The SAT score is significant and the dummy is significant although barely So the adjusted R-squared

31
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,990
of this model is 0.4 to two which is an improvement from the 0.3 9:09 we got last time without attendance

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,750
that's not game changing but is still relevant.

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,550
The original model without the dummy variable was GPA equals zero point for eight plus 0.00 one five

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,770
times the S.A.T. score of a student.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:44,120
The model including the dummy variable is GPA equals zero point eighty seven plus 0.00 1 3 times the

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,770
S.A.T. score of a student plus zero point 1 1 8 4 times the dummy.

37
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,760
Now we said that the dummy is 1 or 0.

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,800
So we can actually represent this equation with two others.

39
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,740
If the student did not attend the dummy will be zero.

40
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,920
So Zero Point 1 1 8 4 times 0 0.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,060
The model becomes GPA equal seven plus 0.00 1 three times.

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,650
S.A. if the student attended the dummy will be one.

43
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:28,470
So the model becomes GPA equals zero point seven plus 0.00 1 3 times as 80 plus 0.1 1 8 for let's add

44
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:36,500
the intercept and the dummy together we get GPA equals zero point nine nine plus zero point zero zero

45
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,780
one three times S.A.T. graphically.

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,490
This looks in the following way.

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,130
So we have two models that have the same slope but they have a different intercept.

48
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,200
The students who attended are spread around the upper line.

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,850
On average their GPA is 0.1 one 8:4 higher than the GPA of students who did not attend

50
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,670
OK to use this model for prediction.

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,690
We need two pieces of information and S.A.T. score and the information whether a person attended more

52
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,000
than 75 percent of their lectures.

53
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:22,170
For example Joshua got hundred on his S.A.T. and did not attend 75 percent of his lessons.

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:30,170
Our model predicts that his graduation GPA will be three point zero eight Jennifer.

55
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:37,000
On the other hand got 670 on the S.A.T. but attended all of her lectures according to our regression.

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:45,350
She is expected to graduate with 3.1 6 as you can see although she scored lower on the S.A.T..

57
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,390
Her attendance turned things around for her.

58
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:55,010
Had we used our previous model with the dummy variable we would have predicted that Joshua would graduate

59
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,730
with three point zero or three and Jenny with 2.9 nine.

60
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,580
While Joshua's GPA barely changed we see a significant difference in the prediction about Jenny

61
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,300
OK this will do in our next lesson.

62
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,500
We will solve a practical example.

63
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,120
We will even use several dummy variables which will ensure you will reinforce what you've learned here.

64
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,170
See you next time.

65
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,380
And thanks for watching.

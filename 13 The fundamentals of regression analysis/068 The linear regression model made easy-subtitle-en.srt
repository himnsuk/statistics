1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,670
High it is time for the actual introduction of regressions.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:11,150
Let's start with some dry theory a linear regression is a linear approximation of a causal relationship

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,390
between two or more variables regressions models are highly valuable as they are one of the most common

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,770
ways to make inferences and predictions.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,590
The process goes like this.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,070
You get sample data come up with a model that explains the data and then make predictions for the whole

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,610
population based on the model you have developed.

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:38,230
There is a dependent variable labeled y being predicted and an independent variable labeled x 1 x 2

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,520
and so forth.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,960
These are the predictors y is a function of the X variables and the regression model is a linear approximation

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,750
of this function.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:56,020
The easiest regression model is the simple linear regression Y is equal to Bayda 0 plus Beta 1 times

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,420
x plus Epsilon.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,670
Let's see what these values mean.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,300
Why is the variable we are trying to predict.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,740
And is called the dependent variable x is the independent variable.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,380
When using regression analysis we want to predict the value of y provided we have the value of x but

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,160
to have a regression Why must depend on x in some causal way whenever there is a change in x such change

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,110
must translate into a change and why think about the following equation.

20
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,250
The income a person receives depends on the number of years of education that person has received the

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,260
dependent variable is income.

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,870
While the independent variable is the years of education there is a causal relationship between the

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,670
two.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,850
The more education you get the higher income you are likely to receive.

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,260
This relationship is so trivial that it is probably the reason you are watching this course right now.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,920
You want to get a higher income so you are increasing your education.

27
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,200
Now let's pause for a second and think about the reverse relationship.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,230
What if education depends on income.

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,310
This would mean the higher your income the more years you spend educating yourself.

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,580
Putting high tuition fees aside wealthier individuals don't spend more years in school and high school

31
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,830
and college take the same number of years.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,800
No matter your tax bracket.

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,360
Therefore a causal relationship like this one is faulty if not plain wrong.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,050
Hence it is unfit for regression analysis.

35
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,010
Let's go back to the original example.

36
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,630
Income is a function of education.

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,140
The more years you study the higher income you'll receive.

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,070
This sounds about right.

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,230
All right.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,200
What we haven't mentioned so far is that in our model there are coefficients bedo one is the coefficient

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,700
that stands before the independent variable.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,840
It quantifies the effect of education on income.

43
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:02,440
If beta 1 is 50 then for each additional year of education your income would grow by $50 in the USA.

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,310
The number is much bigger.

45
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,320
Somewhere around three to five thousand dollars.

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,120
So for each additional year you spend on education your yearly income is expected to rise by three to

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,560
five thousand dollars.

48
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,400
And that's not considering higher education or tailored courses like this one.

49
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,430
The other two components are the constant beta 0 and the error epsilon in this example you can think

50
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,070
of the constant beta zero as the minimum wage no matter your education.

51
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,110
If you have a job you will get the minimum wage.

52
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,710
This is a guaranteed amount.

53
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,440
So if you never went to school and plug in an education value of zero years in the formula the regression

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,660
will predict that your income will be the minimum wage makes sense right.

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,860
The last term is Epsilon.

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,660
This represents the error of estimation.

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,260
The error is the actual difference between the observed income and the income the regression predicted

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,860
on average across all observations.

59
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,370
The error is zero.

60
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,790
If you earn more than what the regression has predicted then someone earns less than what the regression

61
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,130
has predicted.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,190
Everything even Zelle all right.

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,560
The original formula was written with Greek letters.

64
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,290
What does this tell us.

65
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,020
It was the population formula but we know statistics is all about sample data.

66
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,980
In practice we use the linear regression equation.

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,830
It is simply y that equals zero plus be one times x.

68
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,110
You heard it right.

69
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,050
The Y here is referred to as y hat.

70
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,640
Whenever we have a hat symbol it is an estimated or a predicted value be 0 is the estimate of the regression

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,940
constant beta 0.

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,890
While B one is the estimate of beta 1 and X is the sample data for the independent variable.

73
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,400
This will do for now.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
We will discuss this equation in more detail in the next lessons.

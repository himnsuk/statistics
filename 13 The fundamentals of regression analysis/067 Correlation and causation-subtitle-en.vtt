00:00.640 --> 00:06.970
Hi again after we have introduced the topic this lesson will be a lot more quantitative in the first

00:06.970 --> 00:08.060
section of the course.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.530
We talked about correllation.

00:09.610 --> 00:13.680
Remember let's do a quick recap first.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.410
How do we identify a correlation between two variables.

00:17.810 --> 00:23.500
Well one way is to plop them on a scatterplot or a line chart and try to find a pattern.

00:23.510 --> 00:29.980
However as we're getting more acquainted with statistics we would prefer using the correlation coefficient.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.900
Here are the formulas we saw earlier.

00:32.900 --> 00:38.060
All right let's explore a few examples of correlated variables shall we.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.290
Here we have three datasets.

00:40.310 --> 00:44.150
The first one represents the number of movies Vin Diesel makes per year.

00:44.280 --> 00:50.170
The second the U.S. GDP growth rate and the third the UK GDP growth rate.

00:50.420 --> 00:54.100
You can already sense this will be an action packed video.

00:54.110 --> 00:57.920
Let's find the correlation coefficient of these data sets.

00:58.070 --> 01:03.710
I would like to remind you that the correlation coefficients our values from minus 1 to plus one were

01:03.710 --> 01:07.090
zero shows no linear relationship one.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.310
A very strong positive correlation and minus one.

01:10.430 --> 01:17.100
A very strong negative correlation the correlation of Vin Diesel movies and the U.S. GDP growth rate

01:17.160 --> 01:19.250
is 0.4 3.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.370
What's the meaning of this value.

01:21.750 --> 01:27.780
Well a far fetched explanation would be that when times are good and GDP rises Vin Diesel makes more

01:27.780 --> 01:29.390
movies and vice versa.

01:30.200 --> 01:38.360
OK if we calculate the correlation of Vin Diesel movies and the UK GDP growth rate we get 0.4 6.

01:38.390 --> 01:42.870
The number of movies he makes has a stronger correlation with the UK GDP growth.

01:43.010 --> 01:50.060
Although Vinh works in the USA and supposedly has nothing to do with the UK certainly our previous explanation

01:50.060 --> 01:52.090
does not sound convincing.

01:52.100 --> 01:57.450
Finally the correlation of US GDP growth rate and UK GDP growth rate is zero.

01:58.190 --> 02:00.250
Way what's going on.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.510
This doesn't make any sense.

02:02.510 --> 02:08.810
We have to make a few considerations though first does it sound reasonable that gigantic countries like

02:08.810 --> 02:13.930
the USA and the UK will have anything to do with Vin Diesel starring in a film.

02:13.940 --> 02:17.710
Of course not the result we got is pure coincidence.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.350
I assure you that many many things in the world are correlated.

02:21.410 --> 02:24.230
Some even more absurd than our example.

02:24.470 --> 02:27.440
But correlation does not imply causation.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.630
It's easy to find correlations but much harder to find causal relationships to exhaust this example.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.800
We should also comment on the lack of correlation between the US and the UK GDP growth rate.

02:40.190 --> 02:47.690
Well our sample is drawn from the period 2010 to 2015 which is shortly after the US subprime mortgage

02:47.690 --> 02:53.990
crisis and during the European sovereign debt crisis the US and UK were coping with their respective

02:53.990 --> 02:58.010
situations in different ways and the results were mixed.

02:58.130 --> 03:03.320
As you can see the low correlation does not mean one country was doing better than the other.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.330
It shows they are stronger and weaker.

03:05.330 --> 03:08.530
Times were not coinciding in our sample period.

03:08.600 --> 03:14.780
However history tells us that American and European historical growth rates have had a causal relationship

03:14.780 --> 03:18.700
because of trade war and movement of capital and labor.

03:19.490 --> 03:23.840
All right after seeing these three cases what's the bottom line.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.050
Correlation does not imply causation.

03:27.050 --> 03:33.230
This whole lesson was to illustrate that some variables are strangely correlated while others are unexpectedly

03:33.230 --> 03:36.310
uncorrelated in regression analysis.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.970
You will often start with a correlation test to see what's going on with your data.

03:41.390 --> 03:46.620
But be wary as the results could be misleading in the following lessons.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.730
We will get familiar with regressions.

03:48.800 --> 03:54.870
We will take extra time to distinguish between correlation analysis and regression analysis.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.540
All right to conclude.

03:56.580 --> 03:57.950
Let's say it again.

03:57.990 --> 04:00.890
What's the key takeaway from this lesson.

04:00.900 --> 04:01.890
That's right.

04:01.890 --> 04:04.920
Correlation does not imply causation.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.910
Thanks for watching.

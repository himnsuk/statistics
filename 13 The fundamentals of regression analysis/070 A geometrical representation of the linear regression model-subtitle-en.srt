1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's check out the simple linear regression equation once again.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,330
Here it is.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,920
You have probably heard of the regression line.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,650
Right.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,860
When we pull up the data points on an x y plane the regression line is the best fitting line through

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,460
the data points OK.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,760
Here's a plot with some data points.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,210
We plot the line based on the regression equation.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,100
The great points that are scattered are the observed values be 0.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,290
As we said earlier is a constant and is the intercept of the regression line with the y axis.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,730
B One is the slope of the regression line.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,800
It shows how much Y changes for each unit change of x.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,750
The distance between the observed values and the regression line is the estimator of the error term

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,650
Epsilon its point estimate is called residual.

15
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,730
Now if you draw a perpendicular from an observed point to the regression line the intercept between

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,830
that perpendicular and the regression line is a point with a y value equal to y hat.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,060
As we said earlier given in x y.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:15,770
What is the value predicted by the regression line OK our next lesson will be an example of what we

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,800
have seen so far.

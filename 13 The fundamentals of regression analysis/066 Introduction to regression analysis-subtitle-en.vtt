00:00.730 --> 00:06.700
With some solid statistical knowledge behind us we are ready to jump into regression analysis which

00:06.700 --> 00:09.760
is arguably the most common method of prediction.

00:09.850 --> 00:17.110
It is used whenever we have a causal relationship between variables for example among other factors.

00:17.110 --> 00:23.350
The money you spend depends on the money you make in the same way the time you devote to this course

00:23.350 --> 00:26.890
depends on your motivation to learn statistics.

00:26.890 --> 00:32.620
We will use our typical systematic approach starting from the simple linear regression model and reaching

00:32.620 --> 00:38.770
the multivariate regression model along the way we will learn how to build a regression how to interpret

00:38.770 --> 00:41.240
it and how to compare different models.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.060
We will develop a deep understanding of the fundamentals as what we'll learn and this section will be

00:46.060 --> 00:49.230
closely related to the knowledge we've acquired so far.

00:50.070 --> 00:55.680
After this section you will be prepared to dive into more advanced statistical analysis or even machine

00:55.680 --> 00:57.740
learning if that's where you want to go.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.920
Brace yourselves.

00:59.970 --> 01:02.180
Regression analysis starts here.

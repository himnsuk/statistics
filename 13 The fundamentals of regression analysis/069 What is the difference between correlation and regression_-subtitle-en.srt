00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,410
Before we go any further what did we say about correlation.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,470
Correlation does not imply causation.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,890
Let's spend one more minute on that first correlation measures the degree of relationship between two

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,010
variables.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:22,430
Regression analysis is about how one variable affects another or what changes it causes to the other.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,850
Second correlation doesn't capture causality but the degree of interrelation between the two variables.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,510
As with Vin Diesel movies variables we're moving together but were not causing each other.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,130
Regression is based on causality.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,790
It shows no degree of connection but cause and effect.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,620
Third a property of correlation is that the correlation between X and Y is the same as between y and

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,610
X..

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,440
This you can easily see from the formula which is symmetrical regressions of y on X and X on Y.

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,340
You'll different results.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,580
Think about our example with income and education predicting income based on education makes sense.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,270
But the opposite does not.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,630
Finally the two methods have very different graphical representation.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,900
Linear regression analysis is known for the best fitting line that goes through the data points and

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,960
minimizes the distance between them.

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,170
While correlation is a single point alright.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,960
Hopefully this short video clears some doubts you had.

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,300
Stay tuned.

00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,970
Hi again after we have introduced the topic this lesson will be a lot more quantitative in the first

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,060
section of the course.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,530
We talked about correllation.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,680
Remember let's do a quick recap first.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,410
How do we identify a correlation between two variables.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,500
Well one way is to plop them on a scatterplot or a line chart and try to find a pattern.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,980
However as we're getting more acquainted with statistics we would prefer using the correlation coefficient.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,900
Here are the formulas we saw earlier.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,060
All right let's explore a few examples of correlated variables shall we.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,290
Here we have three datasets.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,150
The first one represents the number of movies Vin Diesel makes per year.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,170
The second the U.S. GDP growth rate and the third the UK GDP growth rate.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,100
You can already sense this will be an action packed video.

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,920
Let's find the correlation coefficient of these data sets.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,710
I would like to remind you that the correlation coefficients our values from minus 1 to plus one were

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,090
zero shows no linear relationship one.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,310
A very strong positive correlation and minus one.

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,100
A very strong negative correlation the correlation of Vin Diesel movies and the U.S. GDP growth rate

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,250
is 0.4 3.

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,370
What's the meaning of this value.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,780
Well a far fetched explanation would be that when times are good and GDP rises Vin Diesel makes more

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,390
movies and vice versa.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:38,360
OK if we calculate the correlation of Vin Diesel movies and the UK GDP growth rate we get 0.4 6.

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,870
The number of movies he makes has a stronger correlation with the UK GDP growth.

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:50,060
Although Vinh works in the USA and supposedly has nothing to do with the UK certainly our previous explanation

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,090
does not sound convincing.

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,450
Finally the correlation of US GDP growth rate and UK GDP growth rate is zero.

28
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,250
Way what's going on.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,510
This doesn't make any sense.

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,810
We have to make a few considerations though first does it sound reasonable that gigantic countries like

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,930
the USA and the UK will have anything to do with Vin Diesel starring in a film.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,710
Of course not the result we got is pure coincidence.

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,350
I assure you that many many things in the world are correlated.

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,230
Some even more absurd than our example.

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,440
But correlation does not imply causation.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,630
It's easy to find correlations but much harder to find causal relationships to exhaust this example.

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,800
We should also comment on the lack of correlation between the US and the UK GDP growth rate.

38
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:47,690
Well our sample is drawn from the period 2010 to 2015 which is shortly after the US subprime mortgage

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,990
crisis and during the European sovereign debt crisis the US and UK were coping with their respective

40
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,010
situations in different ways and the results were mixed.

41
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,320
As you can see the low correlation does not mean one country was doing better than the other.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,330
It shows they are stronger and weaker.

43
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,530
Times were not coinciding in our sample period.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,780
However history tells us that American and European historical growth rates have had a causal relationship

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,700
because of trade war and movement of capital and labor.

46
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,840
All right after seeing these three cases what's the bottom line.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,050
Correlation does not imply causation.

48
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:33,230
This whole lesson was to illustrate that some variables are strangely correlated while others are unexpectedly

49
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,310
uncorrelated in regression analysis.

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,970
You will often start with a correlation test to see what's going on with your data.

51
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,620
But be wary as the results could be misleading in the following lessons.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,730
We will get familiar with regressions.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,870
We will take extra time to distinguish between correlation analysis and regression analysis.

54
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,540
All right to conclude.

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,950
Let's say it again.

56
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,890
What's the key takeaway from this lesson.

57
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,890
That's right.

58
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,920
Correlation does not imply causation.

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,910
Thanks for watching.

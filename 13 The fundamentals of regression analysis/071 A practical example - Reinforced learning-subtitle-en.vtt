00:00.710 --> 00:03.040
It's time for an example isn't it.

00:03.200 --> 00:08.230
What we have here is a database with S.A.T. grades and college GPA.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.400
All right.

00:09.410 --> 00:14.000
So we have a sample of 100 students who studied in a given college.

00:14.240 --> 00:20.300
Their total S.A.T. scores include critical reading mathematics and writing and the GPA is the grade

00:20.300 --> 00:23.120
point average they had at graduation.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.080
So what would we do if we had to use our knowledge from previous sections.

00:28.160 --> 00:33.650
The most logical thing would be to see what is the correlation between the two variables S.A.T. grades

00:33.740 --> 00:35.090
and GPA.

00:35.090 --> 00:41.510
The simple correlation is 0.6 for we could then further test if this correlation is significant.

00:41.510 --> 00:48.760
By using hypothesis testing and we would confirm that the two variables are correlated then what these

00:48.760 --> 00:53.540
tests did not give us any information about any under or over achievers.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.730
We have no predictive ability except for seeing the two scores move in the same direction.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.270
Well this is a problem that regression analysis is designed to address.

01:03.490 --> 01:04.700
So let's get on to it.

01:05.540 --> 01:10.050
You can see two scatter plots in the first one on the x axes.

01:10.130 --> 01:17.270
We have a students essay score and on the way axes his GPA in the second one the situation is reversed

01:17.810 --> 01:18.940
on the x axis.

01:19.010 --> 01:26.610
We have the GPA and on the y axes the S.A.T. score we have also included the regression lines.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.320
All right we have two regressions right.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.780
Should we use both to make predictions.

01:32.730 --> 01:36.870
Well this is the hardest part of regression analysis.

01:36.870 --> 01:43.300
In this case one provides a valuable insight and the other is plain wrong and utterly receivable.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.160
The two variables are definitely correlated.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.510
We already tested that.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.500
But what's the causal relationship if there is one.

01:51.670 --> 01:58.860
Let's think about the problem you attend the S.A.T. and get a score with this score you apply to college.

01:59.110 --> 02:05.150
The next four years you attend college and graduate receiving many grades forming your GPA.

02:05.170 --> 02:07.170
So that's your timeline.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.010
What does this mean.

02:09.010 --> 02:16.690
Well the S.A.T. test is taken before you see any exams in college and have a GPA actually three to five

02:16.690 --> 02:18.190
years before that.

02:18.190 --> 02:23.800
Is there any logic in predicting S.A.T. scores using your college graduation GPA.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.480
No there isn't.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.890
This is like predicting how much you spend yesterday based on how much money you found on the street

02:29.890 --> 02:30.800
today.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.240
No logic whatsoever.

02:33.250 --> 02:37.390
Therefore the second regression is meaningless.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.100
What's the takeaway.

02:39.170 --> 02:44.420
Whenever you find data that looks regrettable you should not dive straight into regression analysis

02:44.840 --> 02:48.010
caution and logic should be applied beforehand.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.020
All right.

02:50.020 --> 02:58.420
So I am saying we should predict college GPA using S.A.T. scores but don't believe me just yet use your

02:58.420 --> 03:02.650
logic instead ask yourself what's rationale.

03:03.130 --> 03:10.300
Well the S.A.T. is considered one of the best estimators of intellectual capacity and capability on

03:10.300 --> 03:16.030
average if you did well on your S.A.T. you will do well in college and at the workplace.

03:16.030 --> 03:21.500
Almost all colleges across the USA are using the S.A.T. as a proxy for admission.

03:21.670 --> 03:27.510
The S.A.T. stood the test of time and established itself as the leading exam for college admission.

03:27.550 --> 03:34.770
It is safe to say our regression makes sense OK after we've cleared things up we know which of the two

03:34.770 --> 03:36.230
graphs we should focus on.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.090
You can see the best fitting line between the points.

03:40.140 --> 03:44.270
Also known as the regression line our dependent variable.

03:44.280 --> 03:49.850
Why is college GPA the independent variable x is the S.A.T. score.

03:49.860 --> 03:56.560
A student received the equation that determines the regression line is why hat equals zero point for

03:56.580 --> 04:01.840
8 plus 0.00 1 5 times x OK.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.950
How can we use this equation.

04:04.870 --> 04:11.930
Say you got 1700 on your S.A.T. you plug it in and get a GPA of 3.0 or 3.

04:11.950 --> 04:17.890
Interpreting this result is if you attended the specific college and were admitted with an S.A.T. score

04:17.890 --> 04:19.630
of 1700.

04:19.660 --> 04:27.390
The model predicts you will graduate with a GPA of 3.0 3 What if you got 2000 on your S.A.T..

04:27.580 --> 04:30.440
Your GPA would then be near 3.4 8.

04:30.700 --> 04:34.850
You get the gist of how powerful regression analysis can be.

04:34.890 --> 04:37.250
However there are pitfalls.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.970
What if you've got 2400 on the S.A.T..

04:41.010 --> 04:47.310
Predicted GPA is 4.00 8 from more than the maximum.

04:47.400 --> 04:53.790
Here we touch upon the limitations of regression analysis as the maximum S.A.T. score we had in our

04:53.790 --> 04:55.600
sample was 2050.

04:55.620 --> 05:00.400
It is not correct to make predictions for data points that are outside the regress data.

05:00.600 --> 05:07.230
A possible rationale may be people that go over 2050 on the S.A.T. went to better universities where

05:07.230 --> 05:10.310
it is much harder to get such a high GPA.

05:10.350 --> 05:12.930
All the data was coming from the same college.

05:12.930 --> 05:17.640
Therefore the profile of a typical student there is very specific.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.910
It may be an engineering college or an arts college.

05:20.910 --> 05:23.610
These factors and many more affect the result.

05:23.670 --> 05:29.780
So you should know your data but don't worry we will see enough examples so you will become confident

05:29.780 --> 05:33.010
with identifying and interpreting regressions.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.330
Keep up the good work and thanks for watching.

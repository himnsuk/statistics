1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,040
It's time for an example isn't it.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,230
What we have here is a database with S.A.T. grades and college GPA.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,400
All right.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,000
So we have a sample of 100 students who studied in a given college.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,300
Their total S.A.T. scores include critical reading mathematics and writing and the GPA is the grade

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,120
point average they had at graduation.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,080
So what would we do if we had to use our knowledge from previous sections.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,650
The most logical thing would be to see what is the correlation between the two variables S.A.T. grades

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,090
and GPA.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:41,510
The simple correlation is 0.6 for we could then further test if this correlation is significant.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,760
By using hypothesis testing and we would confirm that the two variables are correlated then what these

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,540
tests did not give us any information about any under or over achievers.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,730
We have no predictive ability except for seeing the two scores move in the same direction.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,270
Well this is a problem that regression analysis is designed to address.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,700
So let's get on to it.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,050
You can see two scatter plots in the first one on the x axes.

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,270
We have a students essay score and on the way axes his GPA in the second one the situation is reversed

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,940
on the x axis.

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:26,610
We have the GPA and on the y axes the S.A.T. score we have also included the regression lines.

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,320
All right we have two regressions right.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,780
Should we use both to make predictions.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,870
Well this is the hardest part of regression analysis.

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:43,300
In this case one provides a valuable insight and the other is plain wrong and utterly receivable.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,160
The two variables are definitely correlated.

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,510
We already tested that.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,500
But what's the causal relationship if there is one.

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,860
Let's think about the problem you attend the S.A.T. and get a score with this score you apply to college.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:05,150
The next four years you attend college and graduate receiving many grades forming your GPA.

29
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,170
So that's your timeline.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,010
What does this mean.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:16,690
Well the S.A.T. test is taken before you see any exams in college and have a GPA actually three to five

32
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,190
years before that.

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,800
Is there any logic in predicting S.A.T. scores using your college graduation GPA.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,480
No there isn't.

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,890
This is like predicting how much you spend yesterday based on how much money you found on the street

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,800
today.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,240
No logic whatsoever.

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,390
Therefore the second regression is meaningless.

39
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,100
What's the takeaway.

40
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,420
Whenever you find data that looks regrettable you should not dive straight into regression analysis

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,010
caution and logic should be applied beforehand.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,020
All right.

43
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:58,420
So I am saying we should predict college GPA using S.A.T. scores but don't believe me just yet use your

44
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,650
logic instead ask yourself what's rationale.

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:10,300
Well the S.A.T. is considered one of the best estimators of intellectual capacity and capability on

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,030
average if you did well on your S.A.T. you will do well in college and at the workplace.

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,500
Almost all colleges across the USA are using the S.A.T. as a proxy for admission.

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,510
The S.A.T. stood the test of time and established itself as the leading exam for college admission.

49
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,770
It is safe to say our regression makes sense OK after we've cleared things up we know which of the two

50
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,230
graphs we should focus on.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,090
You can see the best fitting line between the points.

52
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,270
Also known as the regression line our dependent variable.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,850
Why is college GPA the independent variable x is the S.A.T. score.

54
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,560
A student received the equation that determines the regression line is why hat equals zero point for

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,840
8 plus 0.00 1 5 times x OK.

56
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,950
How can we use this equation.

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,930
Say you got 1700 on your S.A.T. you plug it in and get a GPA of 3.0 or 3.

58
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,890
Interpreting this result is if you attended the specific college and were admitted with an S.A.T. score

59
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,630
of 1700.

60
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:27,390
The model predicts you will graduate with a GPA of 3.0 3 What if you got 2000 on your S.A.T..

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,440
Your GPA would then be near 3.4 8.

62
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,850
You get the gist of how powerful regression analysis can be.

63
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,250
However there are pitfalls.

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,970
What if you've got 2400 on the S.A.T..

65
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,310
Predicted GPA is 4.00 8 from more than the maximum.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,790
Here we touch upon the limitations of regression analysis as the maximum S.A.T. score we had in our

67
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,600
sample was 2050.

68
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,400
It is not correct to make predictions for data points that are outside the regress data.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,230
A possible rationale may be people that go over 2050 on the S.A.T. went to better universities where

70
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,310
it is much harder to get such a high GPA.

71
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,930
All the data was coming from the same college.

72
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,640
Therefore the profile of a typical student there is very specific.

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,910
It may be an engineering college or an arts college.

74
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,610
These factors and many more affect the result.

75
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:29,780
So you should know your data but don't worry we will see enough examples so you will become confident

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,010
with identifying and interpreting regressions.

77
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,330
Keep up the good work and thanks for watching.

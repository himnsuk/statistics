00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,700
With some solid statistical knowledge behind us we are ready to jump into regression analysis which

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,760
is arguably the most common method of prediction.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:17,110
It is used whenever we have a causal relationship between variables for example among other factors.

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,350
The money you spend depends on the money you make in the same way the time you devote to this course

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,890
depends on your motivation to learn statistics.

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,620
We will use our typical systematic approach starting from the simple linear regression model and reaching

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,770
the multivariate regression model along the way we will learn how to build a regression how to interpret

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,240
it and how to compare different models.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,060
We will develop a deep understanding of the fundamentals as what we'll learn and this section will be

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,230
closely related to the knowledge we've acquired so far.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,680
After this section you will be prepared to dive into more advanced statistical analysis or even machine

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,740
learning if that's where you want to go.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,920
Brace yourselves.

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,180
Regression analysis starts here.

00:00.710 --> 00:04.670
High it is time for the actual introduction of regressions.

00:05.030 --> 00:11.150
Let's start with some dry theory a linear regression is a linear approximation of a causal relationship

00:11.150 --> 00:17.390
between two or more variables regressions models are highly valuable as they are one of the most common

00:17.390 --> 00:19.770
ways to make inferences and predictions.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.590
The process goes like this.

00:22.730 --> 00:28.070
You get sample data come up with a model that explains the data and then make predictions for the whole

00:28.070 --> 00:31.610
population based on the model you have developed.

00:31.630 --> 00:38.230
There is a dependent variable labeled y being predicted and an independent variable labeled x 1 x 2

00:38.290 --> 00:39.520
and so forth.

00:39.610 --> 00:46.960
These are the predictors y is a function of the X variables and the regression model is a linear approximation

00:46.990 --> 00:48.750
of this function.

00:48.760 --> 00:56.020
The easiest regression model is the simple linear regression Y is equal to Bayda 0 plus Beta 1 times

00:56.110 --> 00:58.420
x plus Epsilon.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.670
Let's see what these values mean.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.300
Why is the variable we are trying to predict.

01:03.330 --> 01:07.740
And is called the dependent variable x is the independent variable.

01:08.070 --> 01:15.380
When using regression analysis we want to predict the value of y provided we have the value of x but

01:15.480 --> 01:23.160
to have a regression Why must depend on x in some causal way whenever there is a change in x such change

01:23.160 --> 01:28.110
must translate into a change and why think about the following equation.

01:28.370 --> 01:34.250
The income a person receives depends on the number of years of education that person has received the

01:34.250 --> 01:36.260
dependent variable is income.

01:36.290 --> 01:41.870
While the independent variable is the years of education there is a causal relationship between the

01:41.870 --> 01:42.670
two.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.850
The more education you get the higher income you are likely to receive.

01:46.850 --> 01:52.260
This relationship is so trivial that it is probably the reason you are watching this course right now.

01:52.340 --> 01:55.920
You want to get a higher income so you are increasing your education.

01:56.710 --> 02:01.200
Now let's pause for a second and think about the reverse relationship.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.230
What if education depends on income.

02:04.270 --> 02:09.310
This would mean the higher your income the more years you spend educating yourself.

02:09.310 --> 02:15.580
Putting high tuition fees aside wealthier individuals don't spend more years in school and high school

02:15.610 --> 02:17.830
and college take the same number of years.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.800
No matter your tax bracket.

02:19.990 --> 02:25.360
Therefore a causal relationship like this one is faulty if not plain wrong.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.050
Hence it is unfit for regression analysis.

02:29.470 --> 02:32.010
Let's go back to the original example.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.630
Income is a function of education.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.140
The more years you study the higher income you'll receive.

02:38.140 --> 02:40.070
This sounds about right.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.230
All right.

02:41.240 --> 02:48.200
What we haven't mentioned so far is that in our model there are coefficients bedo one is the coefficient

02:48.200 --> 02:50.700
that stands before the independent variable.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.840
It quantifies the effect of education on income.

02:54.140 --> 03:02.440
If beta 1 is 50 then for each additional year of education your income would grow by $50 in the USA.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.310
The number is much bigger.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.320
Somewhere around three to five thousand dollars.

03:07.640 --> 03:14.120
So for each additional year you spend on education your yearly income is expected to rise by three to

03:14.120 --> 03:15.560
five thousand dollars.

03:15.860 --> 03:20.400
And that's not considering higher education or tailored courses like this one.

03:21.150 --> 03:28.430
The other two components are the constant beta 0 and the error epsilon in this example you can think

03:28.430 --> 03:33.070
of the constant beta zero as the minimum wage no matter your education.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.110
If you have a job you will get the minimum wage.

03:36.110 --> 03:38.710
This is a guaranteed amount.

03:38.870 --> 03:45.440
So if you never went to school and plug in an education value of zero years in the formula the regression

03:45.440 --> 03:49.660
will predict that your income will be the minimum wage makes sense right.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.860
The last term is Epsilon.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.660
This represents the error of estimation.

03:55.860 --> 04:01.260
The error is the actual difference between the observed income and the income the regression predicted

04:02.160 --> 04:04.860
on average across all observations.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.370
The error is zero.

04:06.690 --> 04:11.790
If you earn more than what the regression has predicted then someone earns less than what the regression

04:11.790 --> 04:13.130
has predicted.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.190
Everything even Zelle all right.

04:16.230 --> 04:19.560
The original formula was written with Greek letters.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.290
What does this tell us.

04:21.390 --> 04:27.020
It was the population formula but we know statistics is all about sample data.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.980
In practice we use the linear regression equation.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.830
It is simply y that equals zero plus be one times x.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.110
You heard it right.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.050
The Y here is referred to as y hat.

04:40.380 --> 04:47.640
Whenever we have a hat symbol it is an estimated or a predicted value be 0 is the estimate of the regression

04:47.640 --> 04:48.940
constant beta 0.

04:48.960 --> 04:55.890
While B one is the estimate of beta 1 and X is the sample data for the independent variable.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.400
This will do for now.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.120
We will discuss this equation in more detail in the next lessons.

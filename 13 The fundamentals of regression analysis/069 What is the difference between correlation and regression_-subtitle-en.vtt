Before we go any further what did we say about correlation.

00:05.420 --> 00:08.470
Correlation does not imply causation.

00:08.480 --> 00:14.890
Let's spend one more minute on that first correlation measures the degree of relationship between two

00:14.890 --> 00:16.010
variables.

00:16.150 --> 00:22.430
Regression analysis is about how one variable affects another or what changes it causes to the other.

00:22.670 --> 00:28.850
Second correlation doesn't capture causality but the degree of interrelation between the two variables.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.510
As with Vin Diesel movies variables we're moving together but were not causing each other.

00:34.570 --> 00:37.130
Regression is based on causality.

00:37.180 --> 00:40.790
It shows no degree of connection but cause and effect.

00:41.140 --> 00:47.620
Third a property of correlation is that the correlation between X and Y is the same as between y and

00:47.620 --> 00:48.610
X..

00:48.610 --> 00:55.440
This you can easily see from the formula which is symmetrical regressions of y on X and X on Y.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.340
You'll different results.

00:57.340 --> 01:03.580
Think about our example with income and education predicting income based on education makes sense.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.270
But the opposite does not.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.630
Finally the two methods have very different graphical representation.

01:10.740 --> 01:15.900
Linear regression analysis is known for the best fitting line that goes through the data points and

01:15.900 --> 01:17.960
minimizes the distance between them.

01:18.090 --> 01:22.170
While correlation is a single point alright.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.960
Hopefully this short video clears some doubts you had.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.300
Stay tuned.

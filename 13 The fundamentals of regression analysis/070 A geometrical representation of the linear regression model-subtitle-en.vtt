00:00.640 --> 00:04.610
Let's check out the simple linear regression equation once again.

00:04.810 --> 00:06.330
Here it is.

00:06.430 --> 00:08.920
You have probably heard of the regression line.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.650
Right.

00:09.760 --> 00:14.860
When we pull up the data points on an x y plane the regression line is the best fitting line through

00:14.860 --> 00:17.460
the data points OK.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.760
Here's a plot with some data points.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.210
We plot the line based on the regression equation.

00:23.420 --> 00:28.100
The great points that are scattered are the observed values be 0.

00:28.190 --> 00:34.290
As we said earlier is a constant and is the intercept of the regression line with the y axis.

00:34.670 --> 00:37.730
B One is the slope of the regression line.

00:37.730 --> 00:41.800
It shows how much Y changes for each unit change of x.

00:42.170 --> 00:47.750
The distance between the observed values and the regression line is the estimator of the error term

00:47.750 --> 00:52.650
Epsilon its point estimate is called residual.

00:52.650 --> 00:58.730
Now if you draw a perpendicular from an observed point to the regression line the intercept between

00:58.760 --> 01:04.830
that perpendicular and the regression line is a point with a y value equal to y hat.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.060
As we said earlier given in x y.

01:08.060 --> 01:15.770
What is the value predicted by the regression line OK our next lesson will be an example of what we

01:15.770 --> 01:16.800
have seen so far.

00:00.610 --> 00:06.170
All right the second assumption is the so called no endogenous of regressors.

00:06.350 --> 00:12.050
It refers to the prohibition of a link between the independent variables and the errors mathematically

00:12.050 --> 00:14.690
expressed in the following way.

00:14.690 --> 00:20.960
Think about it here the error the difference between the observed values and the predicted values is

00:20.960 --> 00:23.800
correlated with our independent values.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.680
Hmm.

00:25.570 --> 00:32.460
This is a problem referred to as omitted variable bias omitted variable bias is introduced to the model

00:32.470 --> 00:38.970
when you forget to include a relevant variable as each independent variable explains why they moved

00:38.970 --> 00:41.460
together and are somewhat correlated.

00:41.550 --> 00:45.360
Similarily Y is also explained by the omitted variable.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.530
So they are also correlated.

00:47.550 --> 00:53.150
Chances are the omitted variable is also correlated with at least one independent X..

00:53.250 --> 00:56.420
However you forgot to include it as a regressors.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.090
Everything you don't explain with your model goes into the error.

01:00.180 --> 01:07.030
So actually the error becomes correlated with everything else before you are too confused.

01:07.030 --> 01:08.770
I'll give you an example.

01:08.860 --> 01:14.770
Imagine we are trying to predict the price of an apartment building in London based on its size.

01:14.770 --> 01:18.520
This is a rigid model that will have high explanatory power.

01:18.580 --> 01:24.950
However from our sample it seems that the smaller the size of the houses the higher the price.

01:24.970 --> 01:27.800
This is extremely counter intuitive.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.340
We look for remedies and it seems the covariance of the independent variables and the error terms is

01:33.340 --> 01:34.440
not zero.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.850
We are missing something crucial.

01:37.870 --> 01:40.990
Omitted variable bias is hard to fix.

01:40.990 --> 01:45.230
Think of all the things you may have missed that led to this poor result.

01:45.280 --> 01:51.940
We have only one variable but when your model is exhaustive with 10 variables or more you may feel disheartened

01:53.130 --> 01:54.870
critical thinking time.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.120
Where did we draw the sample from.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.230
Can we get a better sample.

01:59.310 --> 02:02.380
Why is bigger real estate cheaper.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.270
All right.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.630
Let me give you more information.

02:05.640 --> 02:10.230
The sample comprises apartment buildings in central London and was large.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.350
So the problem is not with the simple.

02:13.650 --> 02:18.570
From what is it about smaller size that is making it so expensive.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.750
Where are the small houses.

02:20.790 --> 02:26.850
There is rarely construction of new apartment buildings in central London and then you realize the City

02:26.850 --> 02:28.500
of London was in the sample.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.540
The place where most buildings and skyscrapers with some of the most valuable real estate in the world

02:34.110 --> 02:40.410
if central London was just central London we omitted the exact location as a variable in almost any

02:40.410 --> 02:41.120
other city.

02:41.130 --> 02:46.680
This would not be a factor but in our particular example the million dollar suites in the city of London

02:46.680 --> 02:52.500
turn things around after we include a variable that measures if the property is in London city.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.320
Everything falls into place.

02:54.470 --> 02:57.690
Larger properties are more expensive and vice versa.

02:58.880 --> 03:06.320
OK before we wrap up an important remark the incorrect exclusion of a variable like in this case leads

03:06.320 --> 03:12.980
to biased and counter-intuitive estimates that are toxic to your regression analysis and incorrect inclusion

03:12.980 --> 03:18.920
of a variable as we saw in our adjusted r squared lecture leads to inefficient estimates which don't

03:18.920 --> 03:22.020
bias the regression and you can immediately drop them.

03:22.430 --> 03:27.540
So when in doubt just include the variables and try your luck.

03:27.630 --> 03:32.380
Once the bottom line omitted variable bias is a pain in the neck.

03:32.460 --> 03:33.960
It is always different.

03:33.960 --> 03:38.860
Always sneaky and only experience and advance knowledge on the subject can help.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.080
Always check for it.

03:40.140 --> 03:43.430
And if you can't think of anything ask a colleague for assistance.

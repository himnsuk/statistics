1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,770
The penultimate assumption is the No autocorrelation assumption.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,100
It is also known as No serial correlation.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:14,460
This is my least favorite as it cannot be relaxed mathematically it looks like this.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,630
Errors are assumed to be uncorrelated.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,500
Where can we observe serial correlation between errors.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,700
It is highly unlikely to find it in data taken at one moment of time known as cross-sectional data.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,460
However it is very common in time series data.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,460
Think about stock prices every day you have a new quote for the same stock.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,100
These new numbers you see have the same underlying asset with them getting too much into the finance.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,750
Ideally you want them to be random or predicted by macro factors such as GDP tax rate political events

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,740
and so on.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,880
Unfortunately it is common in underdeveloped markets to see patterns in the stock prices.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,310
There is a well-known phenomenon called The Day Of The Week effect.

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,830
It consists in disproportionately high returns on Fridays and low returns on Mondays.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,120
There is no consensus of the true nature of the day of the week effect.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,910
One possible explanation proposed by Nobel Prize winner Emerton Miller is that investors don't have

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,910
time to read all the news immediately.

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,400
So they do it over the weekend the first day to respond to the negative information is on Mondays.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,010
Then during the week their advisors give them new positive information and they start buying on Thursdays

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,940
and Fridays.

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,200
Another famous explanation is given by the distinguished financer Kenneth French who suggested firms

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,100
delay bad news for the weekends.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,030
So markets react on Mondays.

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,310
Whatever the reason there is a correlation of the errors when building regressions about stock prices.

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:57,000
The first observation the sixth the eleventh and the fifth onwards would be Monday's the fifth tenth

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,030
and so on would be Friday's errors on Mondays would be biased downwards and errors for Fridays would

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,980
be biased upwards.

28
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,670
The mathematics of the linear regression does not consider this.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,520
It assumes errors should be randomly spread around the regression line.

30
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,910
So how does one detect autocorrelation.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,510
A common way is to plot all the residuals on a graph and look for patterns.

32
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,970
If you can't find any you're safe but what's the remedy.

33
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,290
You may ask.

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,350
The remedy is there is no remedy.

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,890
I told you in the beginning of this lecture you cannot relax this assumption.

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,520
The only thing you can do is avoid using a linear regression in such a setting.

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,430
There are other types of regressions that deal with time series data.

38
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,610
It is possible to use an auto regressive model a moving average model or even an auto regressive moving

39
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,740
average model.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,530
And I'm not done yet.

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,390
There is also an auto regressive integrated moving average model.

42
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,000
Make your choice as you will but don't use the linear regression model when error terms are auto correlated

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,720
our next lesson will be a lot more encouraging.

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,310
I promise.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
See you there.

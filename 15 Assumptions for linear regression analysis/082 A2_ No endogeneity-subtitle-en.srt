1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,170
All right the second assumption is the so called no endogenous of regressors.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,050
It refers to the prohibition of a link between the independent variables and the errors mathematically

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,690
expressed in the following way.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,960
Think about it here the error the difference between the observed values and the predicted values is

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,800
correlated with our independent values.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,680
Hmm.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,460
This is a problem referred to as omitted variable bias omitted variable bias is introduced to the model

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,970
when you forget to include a relevant variable as each independent variable explains why they moved

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,460
together and are somewhat correlated.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,360
Similarily Y is also explained by the omitted variable.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,530
So they are also correlated.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,150
Chances are the omitted variable is also correlated with at least one independent X..

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,420
However you forgot to include it as a regressors.

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,090
Everything you don't explain with your model goes into the error.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,030
So actually the error becomes correlated with everything else before you are too confused.

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,770
I'll give you an example.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,770
Imagine we are trying to predict the price of an apartment building in London based on its size.

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,520
This is a rigid model that will have high explanatory power.

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,950
However from our sample it seems that the smaller the size of the houses the higher the price.

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,800
This is extremely counter intuitive.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,340
We look for remedies and it seems the covariance of the independent variables and the error terms is

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,440
not zero.

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,850
We are missing something crucial.

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,990
Omitted variable bias is hard to fix.

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,230
Think of all the things you may have missed that led to this poor result.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,940
We have only one variable but when your model is exhaustive with 10 variables or more you may feel disheartened

27
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,870
critical thinking time.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,120
Where did we draw the sample from.

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,230
Can we get a better sample.

30
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,380
Why is bigger real estate cheaper.

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,270
All right.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,630
Let me give you more information.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,230
The sample comprises apartment buildings in central London and was large.

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,350
So the problem is not with the simple.

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,570
From what is it about smaller size that is making it so expensive.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,750
Where are the small houses.

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,850
There is rarely construction of new apartment buildings in central London and then you realize the City

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,500
of London was in the sample.

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,540
The place where most buildings and skyscrapers with some of the most valuable real estate in the world

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,410
if central London was just central London we omitted the exact location as a variable in almost any

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,120
other city.

42
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,680
This would not be a factor but in our particular example the million dollar suites in the city of London

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,500
turn things around after we include a variable that measures if the property is in London city.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Everything falls into place.

45
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,690
Larger properties are more expensive and vice versa.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,320
OK before we wrap up an important remark the incorrect exclusion of a variable like in this case leads

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,980
to biased and counter-intuitive estimates that are toxic to your regression analysis and incorrect inclusion

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,920
of a variable as we saw in our adjusted r squared lecture leads to inefficient estimates which don't

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,020
bias the regression and you can immediately drop them.

50
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,540
So when in doubt just include the variables and try your luck.

51
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,380
Once the bottom line omitted variable bias is a pain in the neck.

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,960
It is always different.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,860
Always sneaky and only experience and advance knowledge on the subject can help.

54
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,080
Always check for it.

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,430
And if you can't think of anything ask a colleague for assistance.

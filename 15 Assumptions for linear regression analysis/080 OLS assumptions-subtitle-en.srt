1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,140
So far we introduce quite a few notions about regressions.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,870
Most statistics books start by introducing regression assumptions directly but we preferred to talk

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,250
about the intuition behind regressions first and then introduce you to regression assumptions.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,170
Now that we have seen quite a few lessons we are ready to introduce regression assumptions here.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,680
We divide them into five assumptions.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,710
You should know all of them and consider them before you perform regression analysis.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,870
We will have a separate lesson for each one.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,500
The first one is linearity.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,920
It is called a linear regression.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,230
As we said earlier there are other types of regressions with more sophisticated models.

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,470
The linear regression is the simplest one and assumes linearity each independent variable is multiplied

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,540
by a coefficient and summed up to predict the value.

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,930
The second one is in Donje linearity of regressors.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,260
Mathematically this is expressed as the covariance of the error and the axes is zero for any error or

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,900
x.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,750
The third assumption is normality in Homosassa Adeste history of the error term.

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,690
Normality means the error term is normally distributed.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,940
The expected value of the error is zero as we expect to have no errors on average almost good s Tisci

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,890
in plain English means constant variance.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,710
We will discuss it thoroughly later.

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,080
The fourth assumption is no autocorrelation.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,940
Mathematically the covariance of any two error terms is zero.

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,220
That's the assumption that would usually stop you from using a linear regression in your analysis and

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,390
the last one is no multi-collinearity multi-collinearity is observed when two or more variables have

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,570
a high correlation between each other.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,820
OK these are the main regression assumptions.

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,030
They are crucial for regression analysis as the purpose of this section was to help you understand regressions.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,770
You should not skip any lectures about assumptions at your workplace.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,720
The biggest mistake you can make is to perform a regression that violates one of these assumptions.

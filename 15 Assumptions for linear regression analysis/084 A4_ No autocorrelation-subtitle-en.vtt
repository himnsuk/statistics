00:00.820 --> 00:04.770
The penultimate assumption is the No autocorrelation assumption.

00:04.870 --> 00:08.100
It is also known as No serial correlation.

00:08.110 --> 00:14.460
This is my least favorite as it cannot be relaxed mathematically it looks like this.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.630
Errors are assumed to be uncorrelated.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.500
Where can we observe serial correlation between errors.

00:21.580 --> 00:27.700
It is highly unlikely to find it in data taken at one moment of time known as cross-sectional data.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.460
However it is very common in time series data.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.460
Think about stock prices every day you have a new quote for the same stock.

00:36.460 --> 00:42.100
These new numbers you see have the same underlying asset with them getting too much into the finance.

00:42.220 --> 00:49.750
Ideally you want them to be random or predicted by macro factors such as GDP tax rate political events

00:49.810 --> 00:50.740
and so on.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.880
Unfortunately it is common in underdeveloped markets to see patterns in the stock prices.

00:57.830 --> 01:01.310
There is a well-known phenomenon called The Day Of The Week effect.

01:01.310 --> 01:06.830
It consists in disproportionately high returns on Fridays and low returns on Mondays.

01:06.830 --> 01:11.120
There is no consensus of the true nature of the day of the week effect.

01:11.120 --> 01:16.910
One possible explanation proposed by Nobel Prize winner Emerton Miller is that investors don't have

01:16.910 --> 01:18.910
time to read all the news immediately.

01:19.010 --> 01:25.400
So they do it over the weekend the first day to respond to the negative information is on Mondays.

01:25.400 --> 01:31.010
Then during the week their advisors give them new positive information and they start buying on Thursdays

01:31.010 --> 01:31.940
and Fridays.

01:33.290 --> 01:39.200
Another famous explanation is given by the distinguished financer Kenneth French who suggested firms

01:39.200 --> 01:41.100
delay bad news for the weekends.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.030
So markets react on Mondays.

01:44.130 --> 01:50.310
Whatever the reason there is a correlation of the errors when building regressions about stock prices.

01:50.370 --> 01:57.000
The first observation the sixth the eleventh and the fifth onwards would be Monday's the fifth tenth

01:57.000 --> 02:03.030
and so on would be Friday's errors on Mondays would be biased downwards and errors for Fridays would

02:03.030 --> 02:04.980
be biased upwards.

02:04.980 --> 02:08.670
The mathematics of the linear regression does not consider this.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.520
It assumes errors should be randomly spread around the regression line.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.910
So how does one detect autocorrelation.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.510
A common way is to plot all the residuals on a graph and look for patterns.

02:21.550 --> 02:25.970
If you can't find any you're safe but what's the remedy.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.290
You may ask.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.350
The remedy is there is no remedy.

02:30.390 --> 02:34.890
I told you in the beginning of this lecture you cannot relax this assumption.

02:34.890 --> 02:40.520
The only thing you can do is avoid using a linear regression in such a setting.

02:40.530 --> 02:44.430
There are other types of regressions that deal with time series data.

02:44.430 --> 02:50.610
It is possible to use an auto regressive model a moving average model or even an auto regressive moving

02:50.610 --> 02:51.740
average model.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.530
And I'm not done yet.

02:53.540 --> 02:58.390
There is also an auto regressive integrated moving average model.

02:58.410 --> 03:04.000
Make your choice as you will but don't use the linear regression model when error terms are auto correlated

03:05.300 --> 03:07.720
our next lesson will be a lot more encouraging.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.310
I promise.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.160
See you there.

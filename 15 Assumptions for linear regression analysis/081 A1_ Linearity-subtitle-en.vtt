00:00.610 --> 00:07.300
The first assumption we will discuss is linearity as we explained earlier a linear regression is the

00:07.300 --> 00:09.670
simplest non-trivial relationship.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.540
It is called linear because the equation is linear.

00:13.540 --> 00:19.630
Each independent variable is multiplied by a coefficient and summed up to predict the value of the dependent

00:19.630 --> 00:21.020
variable.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.810
How can you verify if the relationship between two variables is linear.

00:25.810 --> 00:31.960
The easiest way is to choose an independent variable x one and plot it against the dependent y on a

00:31.960 --> 00:37.690
scatterplot if the data points form a pattern that looks like a straight line then a linear regression

00:37.690 --> 00:39.670
model is suitable.

00:39.690 --> 00:46.230
Let's see a case where the assumption is violated after pulling another variable x 2 against Y on a

00:46.230 --> 00:49.760
scatterplot we see there is no straight line that fits the data.

00:49.770 --> 00:57.580
Well actually a curved line would be a very good fit using a linear regression would not be appropriate.

00:57.600 --> 01:04.030
All clear linearity seems restrictive but there are easy fixes for it.

01:04.120 --> 01:08.390
You can run a non linear regression or transform your relationship.

01:08.470 --> 01:13.000
There are exponential and logarithmic transformations that can help with that.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.010
The quadratic relationship we saw in this video could be easily transformed into a straight line with

01:18.010 --> 01:20.220
the appropriate methods.

01:20.230 --> 01:26.020
The takeaway is if the relationship is nonlinear you should not use the data before transforming it

01:26.020 --> 01:27.160
appropriately.

01:28.160 --> 01:33.920
That summarized linearity next assumption is in Dodge NHT of regressors.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.940
What exactly does it mean.

01:35.990 --> 01:38.300
We'll see in the next lesson.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.200
Thanks for watching.

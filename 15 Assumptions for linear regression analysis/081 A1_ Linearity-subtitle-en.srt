00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:07,300
The first assumption we will discuss is linearity as we explained earlier a linear regression is the

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,670
simplest non-trivial relationship.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,540
It is called linear because the equation is linear.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,630
Each independent variable is multiplied by a coefficient and summed up to predict the value of the dependent

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,020
variable.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,810
How can you verify if the relationship between two variables is linear.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,960
The easiest way is to choose an independent variable x one and plot it against the dependent y on a

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,690
scatterplot if the data points form a pattern that looks like a straight line then a linear regression

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,670
model is suitable.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,230
Let's see a case where the assumption is violated after pulling another variable x 2 against Y on a

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,760
scatterplot we see there is no straight line that fits the data.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,580
Well actually a curved line would be a very good fit using a linear regression would not be appropriate.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,030
All clear linearity seems restrictive but there are easy fixes for it.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,390
You can run a non linear regression or transform your relationship.

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,000
There are exponential and logarithmic transformations that can help with that.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,010
The quadratic relationship we saw in this video could be easily transformed into a straight line with

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,220
the appropriate methods.

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:26,020
The takeaway is if the relationship is nonlinear you should not use the data before transforming it

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,160
appropriately.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,920
That summarized linearity next assumption is in Dodge NHT of regressors.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,940
What exactly does it mean.

22
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,300
We'll see in the next lesson.

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,200
Thanks for watching.

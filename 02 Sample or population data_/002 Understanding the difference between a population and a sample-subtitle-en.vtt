Alright. Before crunching any numbers and making decisions,

1
00:04.110 --> 00:06.610
we should introduce some key definitions.

2
00:06.750 --> 00:11.790
The first step of every statistical analysis you will perform is to determine whether the data you are

3
00:11.790 --> 00:18.180
dealing with is a population, or a sample. 
A population is the collection of all items of interest

4
00:18.180 --> 00:24.120
to our study and is usually denoted with an uppercase N. The numbers we've obtained when using a population

5
00:24.180 --> 00:26.130
The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called parameters.

6
00:26.130 --> 00:32.100
A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase n, and the numbers we've obtained

7
00:32.100 --> 00:35.310
when working with a sample are called: statistics.

8
00:35.310 --> 00:39.610
Now you know why the field we are studying is called statistics.

9
00:39.650 --> 00:45.430
Let's say we want to make a survey of the job prospects of the students studying in the New York University.

10
00:45.470 --> 00:51.810
What is the population?
You can simply walk into NYU and find every student, right?

11
00:52.130 --> 00:56.230
Well probably that would not be the population of NYU students.

12
00:56.450 --> 01:02.510
The population of interest includes not only the students on campus, but also the ones at home, on exchange,

13
01:02.690 --> 01:03.380
abroad,

14
01:03.440 --> 01:08.690
distance education students, part time students, even the ones who are enrolled but are still at high school.

15
01:08.690 --> 01:15.130
Though exhaustive, even this list misses someone. Point taken.

16
01:15.170 --> 01:19.800
Populations are hard to define and hard to observe in real-life.

17
01:19.850 --> 01:23.430
A sample, however, is much easier to contact.

18
01:23.450 --> 01:29.540
It is less time consuming and less costly. 
Time and resources are the main reasons we prefer drawing samples

19
01:29.540 --> 01:33.210
compared to analyzing an entire population.

20
01:33.260 --> 01:39.710
So, let's draw a sample then.
As we first wanted to do, we can just go to the NYU campus.

21
01:39.710 --> 01:43.840
Next let's enter the canteen because we know it will be full of people.

22
01:44.000 --> 01:46.080
We can then interview 50 of them.

23
01:46.220 --> 01:47.240
Cool.

24
01:47.330 --> 01:48.840
This is a sample.

25
01:48.950 --> 01:55.490
Good job! But what are the chances of these 50 people provide us answers that are a true representation

26
01:55.520 --> 01:57.500
of the whole university?

27
01:57.500 --> 01:59.160
Pretty slim, right?

28
01:59.270 --> 02:05.630
The sample is neither random, nor representative. 
A random sample is collected when each member of the

29
02:05.630 --> 02:09.430
sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

30
02:09.440 --> 02:13.810
We must ensure each member is equally likely to be chosen.

31
02:13.820 --> 02:15.670
Let's go back to our example.

32
02:15.740 --> 02:19.920
We walked into the university canteen and violated both conditions.

33
02:20.030 --> 02:22.010
People were not chosen by chance.

34
02:22.040 --> 02:25.550
They were a group of NYU students who were there for lunch.

35
02:25.580 --> 02:30.360
Most members did not even get the chance to be chosen as they were not on campus.

36
02:30.410 --> 02:34.060
Thus we conclude the sample was not random.

37
02:34.100 --> 02:36.640
What about the representativeness of the sample?

38
02:36.890 --> 02:42.680
A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

39
02:42.680 --> 02:44.390
A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

40
02:44.420 --> 02:48.090
Our sample was not random but was it representative?

41
02:48.530 --> 02:55.250
Well, it represented a group of people but definitely not all students in the university to be exact.

42
02:55.280 --> 02:59.240
It represented the people who have lunch at the university canteen.

43
02:59.240 --> 03:04.790
Had our survey been about job prospects of NYU students who eat in the university canteen we would have done well.

44
03:04.790 --> 03:07.370
Had our survey been about job prospects of NYU students who eat in the university canteen we would have done well.

45
03:07.410 --> 03:11.780
By now, you must be wondering how to draw a sample that is both random and representative.

46
03:12.150 --> 03:18.060
Well, the safest way would be to get access to the student database and contact individuals in a random manner.

47
03:18.060 --> 03:18.930
Well, the safest way would be to get access to the student database and contact individuals in a random manner.

48
03:18.930 --> 03:24.500
However, such surveys are almost impossible to conduct without assistance from the university.

49
03:25.460 --> 03:28.470
We said populations are hard to define and observe.

50
03:28.730 --> 03:34.340
Then we saw that sampling is difficult. 
But samples have two big advantages.

51
03:34.430 --> 03:39.870
First, after you have experience, it is not hard to recognize, if a sample is representative.

52
03:40.370 --> 03:44.950
And second statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data.

53
03:45.140 --> 03:49.510
Thus, making a small mistake while sampling is not always a problem.

54
03:49.640 --> 03:50.630
Don't worry.

55
03:50.630 --> 03:55.430
After completing this course samples and populations will be a piece of cake for you!

56
03:55.430 --> 03:56.390
Thanks for watching!

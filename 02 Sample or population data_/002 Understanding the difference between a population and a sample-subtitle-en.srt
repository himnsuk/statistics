1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,050
Alright. Before crunching any numbers and making decisions,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,610
we should introduce some key definitions.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,790
The first step of every statistical analysis you will perform is to determine whether the data you are

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,180
dealing with is a population, or a sample.
A population is the collection of all items of interest

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,120
to our study and is usually denoted with an uppercase N. The numbers we've obtained when using a population

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,130
The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called parameters.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,100
A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase n, and the numbers we've obtained

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,310
when working with a sample are called: statistics.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,610
Now you know why the field we are studying is called statistics.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,430
Let's say we want to make a survey of the job prospects of the students studying in the New York University.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,810
What is the population?
You can simply walk into NYU and find every student, right?

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,230
Well probably that would not be the population of NYU students.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,510
The population of interest includes not only the students on campus, but also the ones at home, on exchange,

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,380
abroad,

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,690
distance education students, part time students, even the ones who are enrolled but are still at high school.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,130
Though exhaustive, even this list misses someone. Point taken.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,800
Populations are hard to define and hard to observe in real-life.

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,430
A sample, however, is much easier to contact.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,540
It is less time consuming and less costly.
Time and resources are the main reasons we prefer drawing samples

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,210
compared to analyzing an entire population.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,710
So, let's draw a sample then.
As we first wanted to do, we can just go to the NYU campus.

22
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,840
Next let's enter the canteen because we know it will be full of people.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
We can then interview 50 of them.

24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,240
Cool.

25
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,840
This is a sample.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,490
Good job! But what are the chances of these 50 people provide us answers that are a true representation

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,500
of the whole university?

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,160
Pretty slim, right?

29
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,630
The sample is neither random, nor representative.
A random sample is collected when each member of the

30
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,430
sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,810
We must ensure each member is equally likely to be chosen.

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,670
Let's go back to our example.

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,920
We walked into the university canteen and violated both conditions.

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,010
People were not chosen by chance.

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,550
They were a group of NYU students who were there for lunch.

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,360
Most members did not even get the chance to be chosen as they were not on campus.

37
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,060
Thus we conclude the sample was not random.

38
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,640
What about the representativeness of the sample?

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,680
A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,390
A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,090
Our sample was not random but was it representative?

42
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,250
Well, it represented a group of people but definitely not all students in the university to be exact.

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,240
It represented the people who have lunch at the university canteen.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,790
Had our survey been about job prospects of NYU students who eat in the university canteen we would have done well.

45
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,370
Had our survey been about job prospects of NYU students who eat in the university canteen we would have done well.

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,780
By now, you must be wondering how to draw a sample that is both random and representative.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,060
Well, the safest way would be to get access to the student database and contact individuals in a random manner.

48
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,930
Well, the safest way would be to get access to the student database and contact individuals in a random manner.

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,500
However, such surveys are almost impossible to conduct without assistance from the university.

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,470
We said populations are hard to define and observe.

51
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,340
Then we saw that sampling is difficult.
But samples have two big advantages.

52
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,870
First, after you have experience, it is not hard to recognize, if a sample is representative.

53
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,950
And second statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data.

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,510
Thus, making a small mistake while sampling is not always a problem.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,630
Don't worry.

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,430
After completing this course samples and populations will be a piece of cake for you!

57
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,390
Thanks for watching!

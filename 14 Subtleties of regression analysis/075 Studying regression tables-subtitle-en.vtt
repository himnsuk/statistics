00:00.570 --> 00:05.670
When you perform regression analysis using software you'll find something different than a scatterplot

00:05.670 --> 00:07.180
with a regression line.

00:07.460 --> 00:09.950
The graph is a visual representation.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.480
And what we really want is to have the equation of the model and a measure of its significance and explanatory

00:15.480 --> 00:16.510
power.

00:16.530 --> 00:21.270
This is the reason the software provides a couple of tables instead of a graph.

00:21.300 --> 00:27.920
In this lesson we will learn how to read and understand these tables typically we will have three main

00:27.920 --> 00:33.330
tables a model summary and a nova table and a table with coefficients.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.330
Here's what we have in Excel.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.900
These tables contain all kinds of information.

00:37.910 --> 00:39.800
So let me quickly clear it up.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.560
We want to see only information that is important and relevant.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.400
All right.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.940
First we have the model summary.

00:48.090 --> 00:53.390
It will contain the R-squared the sample size and the standard error of the estimate.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.920
We already know what the R squared is.

00:56.160 --> 01:01.920
The standard error of the estimate similarily to the standard errors we have seen so far is a correction

01:01.950 --> 01:05.820
of the standard deviation that takes into account the sample size.

01:05.820 --> 01:10.780
The formula is square root of SSD divided by and minus 2.

01:11.100 --> 01:16.830
We will not dig deeper into this topic but as we had with inferential statistics the bigger the sample

01:16.830 --> 01:21.610
size the lower the standard error and the better the model.

01:21.790 --> 01:28.840
The second table is a nova and Nova is an abbreviation of analysis of variance and is a collection of

01:28.840 --> 01:33.760
statistical models used for comparing means in the context of regressions.

01:33.790 --> 01:43.090
The Nova table summarizes the variance we've talked about so far as s t ss are an SSD in the Nova table.

01:43.090 --> 01:49.310
You will also find the statistic which we will discuss in a separate lesson.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.090
The third table is the coefficients table.

01:52.370 --> 01:55.330
If you are new to regression analysis you wouldn't know.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.340
But this is the heart of the regression.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.560
So get excited.

01:59.660 --> 02:06.740
The first row describes the intercept while the second row the independent variable OK.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.550
Now let's go column by column.

02:09.880 --> 02:16.490
The first one is about the coefficients we can see the coefficient of the intercept is zero point 4

02:16.520 --> 02:21.680
8 0 or 3 which means be 0 is zero point 4 8 0 3.

02:21.950 --> 02:27.530
Looking below we notice the other coefficient is zero point 0 0 1 5.

02:27.590 --> 02:30.040
This is our b one.

02:30.130 --> 02:36.720
These are the only two numbers we need to define the regression equation Y had equals zero point 4 8

02:36.750 --> 02:44.320
0 3 plus 0.00 1 5 times x that is also the correct way to get the regression equation.

02:45.920 --> 02:50.510
Next we have the standard errors of each estimate which we will need in a second.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.790
The two values are a t statistic and it's P-value.

02:56.190 --> 03:01.660
If you have paid close attention to the course you will know there is a hypothesis involved here.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.870
The null hypothesis of this test is beta equals zero.

03:06.870 --> 03:10.340
In other words is the coefficient equal to zero.

03:10.680 --> 03:18.170
If a coefficient is zero for the intercept be 0 that is then the line crosses the y axes at the origin.

03:19.790 --> 03:24.910
If beta 1 is zero then 0 times X will always be NULL for any x.

03:24.950 --> 03:28.840
So this variable will not be considered for the model.

03:28.860 --> 03:31.650
Let's paraphrase the null hypothesis.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.760
Essentially it means is this variable useful.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.930
Does it help us explain the variability we have in this case.

03:39.960 --> 03:46.060
The answer is contained in the p value column as we have discussed earlier in this course.

03:46.140 --> 03:52.510
We are longing for those three zeros but it is up to the researcher to choose the significance level

03:53.760 --> 03:58.790
in our example the S.A.T. score is significant in determining college GPA.

03:59.930 --> 04:04.370
What you may notice is that the int. p value is not zero.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.070
Let's think about this.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.780
Does it matter that much.

04:08.060 --> 04:12.220
Even if the p value is large the intercept is insignificant.

04:12.350 --> 04:18.560
So the test is about do we have enough statistical evidence that the intercept differs from 0.

04:18.650 --> 04:28.000
Usually this is not essential as it is the x's we are interested in all right starting from our next

04:28.000 --> 04:28.660
lesson.

04:28.780 --> 04:33.360
We will get into more serious regression analysis by exploring multivariate regressions.

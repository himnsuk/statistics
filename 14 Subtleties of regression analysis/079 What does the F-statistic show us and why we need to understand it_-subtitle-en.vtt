In the lecture about regression tables we mentioned the statistic which we saw in the Nova table.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.430
Let's try to explain its essence and see how it's useful to us.

00:10.710 --> 00:16.140
Much like the Z statistic that follows a normal distribution and the t statistic that follows the Student's

00:16.140 --> 00:17.240
t distribution.

00:17.370 --> 00:20.760
The F statistic follows an F distribution.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.650
I'm calling it a statistic.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.170
So it is used for tests right.

00:25.170 --> 00:31.270
You guessed correctly the test is known as the test for overall significance of the model.

00:31.350 --> 00:36.760
The null hypothesis is all the betas are equal to zero simultaneously.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.410
The alternative hypothesis is at least one Bayda defers from zero.

00:42.410 --> 00:48.210
What's the interpretation if all betas are zero then none of the independent variables matter.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.690
Therefore our model has no merit.

00:51.590 --> 00:56.430
Let's see the Nova table for the S.A.T. score college GPA regression.

00:56.690 --> 01:02.690
The statistic is fifty five point five and its p value is zero point zero zero zero.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.990
We say the overall model is significant.

01:05.990 --> 01:10.310
Notice how the p value is a universal measure for all tests.

01:10.310 --> 01:16.570
There is an F table used for the F statistic but we don't need it because the p value notion is so powerful

01:17.860 --> 01:23.120
the F-test is important for multivariate regressions as it gives us some important insights.

01:23.440 --> 01:28.930
Let's see the Nova table for the model where we added the random 1 to 3 variable that had nothing to

01:28.930 --> 01:30.530
do with anything.

01:30.550 --> 01:36.790
The statistic is twenty seven point eight and the p value is zero point zero zero zero.

01:36.820 --> 01:39.420
You can see the f statistic is lower.

01:39.580 --> 01:46.900
The model is still significant but less so the lower the statistic the closer to a non-significant model.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.950
This is yet another tool that allows us to compare models OK.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.970
This was the test for overall significance of the model.

01:55.190 --> 01:58.430
Don't forget to look for the three zeros after the dot.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.960
And thanks for watching.

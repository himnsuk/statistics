1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,350
High again so far we decompose the total variability of the observed data into explained and unexplained.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,580
We've also noted the smaller the regression error the better the regression.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,220
But this is statistics.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,890
So there must be at least one widely used measure that describes how powerful a regression is.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,560
Right.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,310
Well fortunately or unfortunately depending on your attitude there is.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,120
Let me introduce you to the R-squared the R-Squared is an intuitive and practical tool when in the right

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,640
hands it is equal to SS are divided by ss t as you should recall.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:47,640
Ss r is the variability explained by the regression while S S T is the total variability of the dataset.

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,250
So what does it mean.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,580
It's a relative measure that takes values ranging from 0 to 1 an R squared of zero means a regression

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,220
line explains none of the variability of the data and R-squared of one would mean your model explains

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,760
the entire variability of the data.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,400
Unfortunately regression is explaining the entire variability are rare.

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,890
What you will usually observe is values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 the immediate question.

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,660
Any student is compelled to ask is what is a good R-squared.

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,940
When do I know for sure my regression is good enough.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,350
I regret to inform you there is no definite answer to that in the field of physics and chemistry.

19
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,810
Scientists are usually looking for regressions with R squared between 0.7 and 0.9.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,230
However in social sciences such as economics finance and psychology an R-squared of 0.2 or 20 percent

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,420
of the variability explained by the model could be fantastic.

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,180
It depends on the complexity of the topic and how many variables are believed to be in play.

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,560
Think about income once more.

24
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,610
It may depend on your household income including your parents and spouse your education years of experience.

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,390
Country you are living in languages you speak and this may still account for less than 50 percent of

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,240
the variability of income.

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,590
Your salary is a very complex issue but you probably know that.

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,080
Let's check an example we saw before S.A.T. score and call his GPA.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,560
We said that the S.A.T. score is one of the better determinants of intellectual capacity and capability.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,460
The truth is that our regression had an R-squared of zero point for 0 6 or in other words as SAT scores

31
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,420
explained 41 percent of the variability of the college grades for our sample.

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,790
An R-squared of 41 percent is neither good nor bad but since it is far away from 90 percent we may conclude

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,570
we are missing some important information other determinants must be considered variables such as gender

34
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,620
income and marital status could help us understand the full picture a little better.

35
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,910
OK should we move on.

36
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,630
Wait what did I say in this section.

37
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,870
Don't jump into regressing.

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,300
Critical thinking is crucial before agreeing that a factor is significant.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,020
You should try to understand why.

40
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,920
So let's quickly justify that claim first.

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,860
Women are more likely to outperform men in high school but then in higher education more men enter academia.

42
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,680
There are many biases in place here without telling you if female or male candidates are better.

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,060
Scientific research shows that a gender gap exists in education.

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,740
Gender is an important input for any regression on the topic.

45
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,760
The second factor we pointed out is income.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,450
If your household income is low you are more likely to get a part time job thus you'll have less time

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,270
for studying and probably get lower grades.

48
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,980
If you've ever been to college you will surely remember a friend who underperformed because of this

49
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,650
reason.

50
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,920
Third if you get married and have a child you'll definitely have a lower attendance.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,300
Contrary to what most students think when in college attendance is a significant factor for your GPA.

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,380
You may think your time is better spent when skipping a lecture but your GPA begs to differ.

53
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,900
All right after these clarifications let's find the bottom line.

54
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,960
The R squared measures the goodness of fit of your model the more factors you include in your regression

55
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,610
the higher the R-squared.

56
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,250
So should we include gender and income in our regression.

57
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,140
If this is in line with our research and their inclusion results in a better model we should do that.

58
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,490
However we'll talk about regressions with more variables later in the course.

59
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,380
In this lesson we built a solid understanding of how our squared functions.

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,720
Excellent.

61
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,080
Next we will learn how to find a regressions regression line.

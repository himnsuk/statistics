00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,670
In the lecture about regression tables we mentioned the statistic which we saw in the Nova table.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,430
Let's try to explain its essence and see how it's useful to us.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,140
Much like the Z statistic that follows a normal distribution and the t statistic that follows the Student's

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,240
t distribution.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,760
The F statistic follows an F distribution.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,650
I'm calling it a statistic.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,170
So it is used for tests right.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,270
You guessed correctly the test is known as the test for overall significance of the model.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,760
The null hypothesis is all the betas are equal to zero simultaneously.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,410
The alternative hypothesis is at least one Bayda defers from zero.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,210
What's the interpretation if all betas are zero then none of the independent variables matter.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,690
Therefore our model has no merit.

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,430
Let's see the Nova table for the S.A.T. score college GPA regression.

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,690
The statistic is fifty five point five and its p value is zero point zero zero zero.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,990
We say the overall model is significant.

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,310
Notice how the p value is a universal measure for all tests.

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,570
There is an F table used for the F statistic but we don't need it because the p value notion is so powerful

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,120
the F-test is important for multivariate regressions as it gives us some important insights.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,930
Let's see the Nova table for the model where we added the random 1 to 3 variable that had nothing to

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,530
do with anything.

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,790
The statistic is twenty seven point eight and the p value is zero point zero zero zero.

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,420
You can see the f statistic is lower.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,900
The model is still significant but less so the lower the statistic the closer to a non-significant model.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,950
This is yet another tool that allows us to compare models OK.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,970
This was the test for overall significance of the model.

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,430
Don't forget to look for the three zeros after the dot.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,960
And thanks for watching.

Okay great.

00:02.460 --> 00:07.430
So we've arrived at the point where we will learn how to find the regression line.

00:07.590 --> 00:14.430
The most common method to do that is called the O LS or the ordinary least squares method least squares

00:14.430 --> 00:17.760
stands for the minimum squares error or ss.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.920
You may recall that a lower error results in a better explanatory power of the regression model.

00:23.940 --> 00:30.800
So this method aims to find the line which minimizes the sum of squared errors.

00:30.810 --> 00:34.200
All right let's clarify things with this graph.

00:34.440 --> 00:42.190
We can find many lines that fit the data the LS determines the one with the smallest error graphically.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.800
It is the one closest to all points simultaneously.

00:46.390 --> 00:49.870
The expression used to do this is this one.

00:50.090 --> 00:53.630
But how is this formula applied well.

00:53.740 --> 01:00.010
This is a minimization problem that uses calculus and linear algebra to determine the slope and intercept

01:00.010 --> 01:01.330
of the line.

01:01.330 --> 01:08.140
After you crunch the numbers you'll find the intercept is be zero and the slope is be one knowing the

01:08.140 --> 01:09.190
coefficients.

01:09.190 --> 01:11.840
Here you have it your regression equation.

01:12.670 --> 01:18.750
We can try minimizing the square sum of errors on paper but with data sets comprising thousands of values.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.750
This is almost impossible nowadays.

01:21.790 --> 01:29.930
Regression analysis is performed through software beginners statisticians prefer Excel SPSS SJS and

01:29.950 --> 01:34.300
stat for calculations data analysis and data scientists.

01:34.360 --> 01:40.690
However faver programming languages like R and Python as they offer limitless capabilities and unmatched

01:40.690 --> 01:42.560
speed.

01:42.560 --> 01:47.720
Finally we must know that there are other methods for determining the regression line.

01:47.720 --> 01:50.340
They are prefered in different contexts.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.110
Such examples are the Bazy and regression the kernel regression and the garage in process regression.

01:57.120 --> 02:03.300
However the least squares method is simple yet powerful enough for many if not most problems.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.810
We will stick with it.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.900
Thanks for watching.

00:00.630 --> 00:08.350
High again so far we decompose the total variability of the observed data into explained and unexplained.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.580
We've also noted the smaller the regression error the better the regression.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.220
But this is statistics.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.890
So there must be at least one widely used measure that describes how powerful a regression is.

00:19.020 --> 00:19.560
Right.

00:20.340 --> 00:26.310
Well fortunately or unfortunately depending on your attitude there is.

00:26.310 --> 00:33.120
Let me introduce you to the R-squared the R-Squared is an intuitive and practical tool when in the right

00:33.120 --> 00:39.640
hands it is equal to SS are divided by ss t as you should recall.

00:39.660 --> 00:47.640
Ss r is the variability explained by the regression while S S T is the total variability of the dataset.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.250
So what does it mean.

00:49.950 --> 00:56.580
It's a relative measure that takes values ranging from 0 to 1 an R squared of zero means a regression

00:56.580 --> 01:02.220
line explains none of the variability of the data and R-squared of one would mean your model explains

01:02.250 --> 01:04.760
the entire variability of the data.

01:04.770 --> 01:09.400
Unfortunately regression is explaining the entire variability are rare.

01:09.420 --> 01:16.890
What you will usually observe is values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 the immediate question.

01:16.900 --> 01:21.660
Any student is compelled to ask is what is a good R-squared.

01:21.730 --> 01:25.940
When do I know for sure my regression is good enough.

01:25.960 --> 01:32.350
I regret to inform you there is no definite answer to that in the field of physics and chemistry.

01:32.350 --> 01:38.810
Scientists are usually looking for regressions with R squared between 0.7 and 0.9.

01:38.840 --> 01:47.230
However in social sciences such as economics finance and psychology an R-squared of 0.2 or 20 percent

01:47.440 --> 01:51.420
of the variability explained by the model could be fantastic.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.180
It depends on the complexity of the topic and how many variables are believed to be in play.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.560
Think about income once more.

01:59.610 --> 02:06.610
It may depend on your household income including your parents and spouse your education years of experience.

02:06.750 --> 02:12.390
Country you are living in languages you speak and this may still account for less than 50 percent of

02:12.390 --> 02:14.240
the variability of income.

02:14.430 --> 02:19.590
Your salary is a very complex issue but you probably know that.

02:19.650 --> 02:25.080
Let's check an example we saw before S.A.T. score and call his GPA.

02:25.080 --> 02:31.560
We said that the S.A.T. score is one of the better determinants of intellectual capacity and capability.

02:31.560 --> 02:38.460
The truth is that our regression had an R-squared of zero point for 0 6 or in other words as SAT scores

02:38.510 --> 02:43.420
explained 41 percent of the variability of the college grades for our sample.

02:43.420 --> 02:50.790
An R-squared of 41 percent is neither good nor bad but since it is far away from 90 percent we may conclude

02:50.790 --> 02:57.570
we are missing some important information other determinants must be considered variables such as gender

02:57.780 --> 03:02.620
income and marital status could help us understand the full picture a little better.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.910
OK should we move on.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.630
Wait what did I say in this section.

03:08.910 --> 03:10.870
Don't jump into regressing.

03:11.100 --> 03:16.300
Critical thinking is crucial before agreeing that a factor is significant.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.020
You should try to understand why.

03:18.150 --> 03:21.920
So let's quickly justify that claim first.

03:21.940 --> 03:29.860
Women are more likely to outperform men in high school but then in higher education more men enter academia.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.680
There are many biases in place here without telling you if female or male candidates are better.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.060
Scientific research shows that a gender gap exists in education.

03:40.060 --> 03:43.740
Gender is an important input for any regression on the topic.

03:44.660 --> 03:47.760
The second factor we pointed out is income.

03:47.810 --> 03:53.450
If your household income is low you are more likely to get a part time job thus you'll have less time

03:53.450 --> 03:56.270
for studying and probably get lower grades.

03:56.420 --> 04:00.980
If you've ever been to college you will surely remember a friend who underperformed because of this

04:00.980 --> 04:01.650
reason.

04:02.770 --> 04:07.920
Third if you get married and have a child you'll definitely have a lower attendance.

04:07.930 --> 04:14.300
Contrary to what most students think when in college attendance is a significant factor for your GPA.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.380
You may think your time is better spent when skipping a lecture but your GPA begs to differ.

04:20.590 --> 04:24.900
All right after these clarifications let's find the bottom line.

04:25.110 --> 04:30.960
The R squared measures the goodness of fit of your model the more factors you include in your regression

04:31.170 --> 04:33.610
the higher the R-squared.

04:33.620 --> 04:38.250
So should we include gender and income in our regression.

04:38.350 --> 04:44.140
If this is in line with our research and their inclusion results in a better model we should do that.

04:44.170 --> 04:48.490
However we'll talk about regressions with more variables later in the course.

04:49.570 --> 04:54.380
In this lesson we built a solid understanding of how our squared functions.

04:54.430 --> 04:55.720
Excellent.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.080
Next we will learn how to find a regressions regression line.

Hi my name is Illya and I will be taking you through statistics for data science and business analysis.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.840
I am a business graduate with a strong affinity for numbers.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.570
I love statistics and mathematics.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.150
In fact I enjoy the subject so much.

00:17.170 --> 00:22.960
I have competed nationally and internationally and have won multiple awards in college.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.970
Competing was no longer a priority.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.180
So I turned to teaching statistics and mathematics.

00:28.180 --> 00:32.200
I helped many people with their statistics and econometric studies.

00:32.200 --> 00:39.680
My first happy students in this course we will cover some of my favorite topics and I am super excited.

00:39.690 --> 00:43.210
I hope you are too because this will be a great journey.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.140
First we will start with the very basics we will learn about the different types of data and we will

00:49.140 --> 00:52.310
distinguish between population and sample data.

00:52.440 --> 00:57.390
We will study the levels of measurement we can use the difference between categorical and numerical

00:57.390 --> 01:04.510
variables how to plot data how to measure mean median and mode and how to quantify variability.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.260
Once we have covered the introductory part of the course we will be ready to learn about the Central

01:09.260 --> 01:10.180
Limit Theorem.

01:10.250 --> 01:17.440
Normal Distribution Student's t distribution and how to create use and interpret confidence intervals.

01:17.450 --> 01:22.820
These are some of the indispensable tools you need when making business decisions relying on data.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.770
You must be able to make predictions under uncertainty and that's precisely what you can do.

01:27.770 --> 01:33.950
After completing this part of the course then we will move on to hypothesis testing which is at the

01:33.950 --> 01:35.810
heart of decision making.

01:35.900 --> 01:39.980
Each data driven decision comes after a hypothesis test.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.370
You will learn how to formulate a hypothesis and act according to the result.

01:45.540 --> 01:52.090
In the fourth part of the course we will dive into the world of regression analysis regression analysis

01:52.180 --> 01:57.460
is a powerful tool that allows us to build predictive models based on causal relationships.

01:57.670 --> 02:01.330
Specifically we will concentrate on the LS setting.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.580
The most widely used framework for statistical regressions.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.640
Sounds great doesn't it.

02:07.640 --> 02:12.310
This will be an awesome adventure to get the most out of this course.

02:12.320 --> 02:17.020
Please don't skip any lectures as we will gradually build on your knowledge.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.850
Also the concepts you will learn in the first part of the course will be useful later on.

02:22.670 --> 02:28.040
Now the lessons in this course contain several downloadable resources that will help you reinforce what

02:28.040 --> 02:29.210
you have learned.

02:29.230 --> 02:36.170
Of course notes exercise files PBF materials handy notebook files everything is included and can be

02:36.170 --> 02:38.000
downloaded easily.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.150
I strongly suggest you complete all the exercises as they are designed not only for practice but also

02:44.150 --> 02:48.480
as an additional source of information that deepens your understanding of statistics.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.610
Feel free to post on the course discussion board.

02:51.620 --> 02:56.690
If you experience difficulties I would like to ask a question or simply want to share something with

02:56.690 --> 03:01.370
the community this course is extraordinary on its own.

03:01.410 --> 03:08.430
However on top of that if you complete it you will also get free access to two of our other courses.

03:08.430 --> 03:15.420
Microsoft Excel 2016 beginner and intermediate training provided you complete 50 percent of the course

03:15.690 --> 03:21.450
and beginner to pro in PowerPoint provided you complete 100 percent of the course.

03:22.220 --> 03:23.580
Are you excited.

03:23.930 --> 03:27.960
Awesome dive straight in and let's begin this journey together.

00:00.660 --> 00:06.390
The standard normal distribution is a particular case of the normal distribution we'll use the letter

00:06.390 --> 00:07.870
Z to denote it.

00:07.920 --> 00:15.000
It has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the standard normal distribution is easy to understand

00:15.060 --> 00:17.240
and has several important applications.

00:17.610 --> 00:24.090
Every normal distribution can be standardized standardization in this context is the process of turning

00:24.090 --> 00:28.500
a normally distributed variable to one with a standard normal distribution.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.720
A simple formula allows us to do that.

00:31.910 --> 00:36.870
The standardized variable the variable whose normal distribution we are turning into a standard normal

00:36.870 --> 00:43.780
distribution is called a z score it is equal to the original variable minus its mean divided by its

00:43.800 --> 00:45.720
standard deviation.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.360
Let's try to interpret it first.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.200
We have to look at the numerator.

00:50.460 --> 00:55.260
If you take a dataset subtract its mean from each data point and then calculate the mean.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.130
Once again you will get zero.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.820
The following example will help us prove that.

01:01.240 --> 01:10.720
Let's take an approximately normally distributed set of numbers 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 and 5.

01:10.740 --> 01:15.460
Its mean is 3 and its standard deviation 1.2 2.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.790
Now lets have tracked the mean from all data points.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.980
We get a new dataset of minus two minus 1 minus 1 0 0 0 1 1 and 2.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.560
Let's calculate the mean.

01:29.740 --> 01:33.160
It is 0 exactly as we anticipated.

01:33.160 --> 01:33.840
Clear.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.650
OK great.

01:36.010 --> 01:40.540
So far we have a new distribution which is still normal but with a mean of zero.

01:40.540 --> 01:47.710
Any standard deviation of 1.2 to the next step of standardization is to divide all data points by the

01:47.710 --> 01:49.210
standard deviation.

01:49.210 --> 01:53.550
This will drive the standard deviation of the new data set to 1.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.450
Let's go back to our example.

01:55.660 --> 02:00.850
Both the original data set and the one we obtained after subtracting the mean from each data point have

02:00.850 --> 02:05.000
a standard deviation of 1.2 to remember.

02:05.110 --> 02:10.330
Adding and subtracting to all data points does not change the standard deviation.

02:10.330 --> 02:23.800
Now let's divide each data point by 1.2 to we get minus 1.6 3 minus 0.8 to minus 0.8 to 0 0 0 0.8 to

02:23.920 --> 02:26.970
zero point a two and 1.6 three.

02:27.100 --> 02:33.520
If we calculate the standard deviation of this dataset we will get one and the mean is still zero.

02:33.730 --> 02:36.840
Let's quickly show that cool.

02:36.980 --> 02:42.320
This is how we can obtain a standard normal distribution from any normally distributed data set.

02:43.070 --> 02:46.230
Using it makes predictions and inference much easier.

02:46.310 --> 02:49.970
And this will help us a great deal in what we will see next.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.990
Thanks for watching.

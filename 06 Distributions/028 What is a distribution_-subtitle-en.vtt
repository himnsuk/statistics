00:00.910 --> 00:05.230
Before we can talk about testing we have to learn what a distribution is.

00:05.230 --> 00:12.190
And in this lesson we'll do just that in statistics when we use the term distribution we usually mean

00:12.220 --> 00:14.410
a probability distribution.

00:14.410 --> 00:21.050
Good examples are the normal distribution the binomial distribution and the uniform distribution.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.110
All right let's start with a definition.

00:24.290 --> 00:30.810
A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

00:31.250 --> 00:35.970
Think about Addai it has 6 sides numbered from 1 to 6.

00:36.110 --> 00:37.190
We roll the die.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.350
What is the probability of getting one.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.930
It is 1 out of 6.

00:41.930 --> 00:43.830
So 1 6 3.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.710
What is the probability of getting 2.

00:46.820 --> 00:48.940
Once again one sixth.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.030
The same holds for 3 4 5 and 6.

00:53.050 --> 00:56.880
Now what is the probability of getting a 7.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.830
It is impossible to get a 7 when rolling a die.

00:59.890 --> 01:02.580
Therefore the probability is zero.

01:03.490 --> 01:08.710
The distribution of an event consists not only of the input values that can be observed but is made

01:08.710 --> 01:11.010
up of all the possible values.

01:11.320 --> 01:17.660
So the distribution of the event rolling a die will be given by the following table.

01:17.740 --> 01:26.150
The probability of getting 1 is 0.17 the probability of getting 2 is 0.17 and so on.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.780
You are sure that you have exhausted all possible values when the sum of the probabilities is equal

01:31.780 --> 01:35.230
to 100 percent for all other values.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.710
The probability of occurrence is zero.

01:38.590 --> 01:45.070
Each probability distribution is associated with a graph describing the likelihood of occurrence of

01:45.190 --> 01:46.320
every event.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.880
Here's the graph for our example.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.560
This type of distribution is called uniform distribution.

01:53.420 --> 01:59.420
It is crucial to understand that the distribution is defined by the underlying probabilities and not

01:59.420 --> 02:00.620
the graph.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.310
The graph is just a visual representation.

02:04.430 --> 02:05.110
All right.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.660
Now think about rolling two dice.

02:07.690 --> 02:13.960
What are the possibilities 1 and 1 2 and 1 1 and 2 and so on.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.360
Here's a table with all the possible combinations.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.470
We are interested in the sum of two dice.

02:20.680 --> 02:27.910
So what's the probability of getting a sum of 1 0 as this event is impossible.

02:27.910 --> 02:30.750
What's the probability of getting a sum of two.

02:30.760 --> 02:37.180
There is only one combination that would give us the sum of two when both dice are equal to 1.

02:37.180 --> 02:45.190
So 1 out of 36 total outcomes or zero point zero or three Similarily the probability of getting a sum

02:45.190 --> 02:51.080
of three is given by the number of combinations that give a sum of three divided by 36.

02:51.220 --> 03:00.680
Therefore two divided by 36 or 0.06 we continue this way until we have the full probability distribution.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.430
Let's see the graph associated with it.

03:03.690 --> 03:09.690
All right so looking at it we understand that when we roll two dice the probability of getting a seven

03:09.690 --> 03:11.070
is the highest.

03:11.070 --> 03:17.010
We can also compare different outcomes such as the probability of getting a 10 and the probability of

03:17.010 --> 03:18.070
getting a 5.

03:18.360 --> 03:22.950
It's evident that it's less likely that we'll get a 10 grade.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.030
The examples that we saw here were of discrete variables.

03:27.030 --> 03:33.120
Next we will focus on continuous distributions as they are more common in inferences.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.340
In the next few lessons we'll examine some of the main types of continuous distributions starting with

03:38.340 --> 03:39.630
the normal distribution.

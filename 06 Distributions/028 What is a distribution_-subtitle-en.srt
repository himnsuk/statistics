1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,230
Before we can talk about testing we have to learn what a distribution is.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:12,190
And in this lesson we'll do just that in statistics when we use the term distribution we usually mean

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,410
a probability distribution.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,050
Good examples are the normal distribution the binomial distribution and the uniform distribution.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,110
All right let's start with a definition.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,810
A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,970
Think about Addai it has 6 sides numbered from 1 to 6.

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,190
We roll the die.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,350
What is the probability of getting one.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,930
It is 1 out of 6.

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,830
So 1 6 3.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,710
What is the probability of getting 2.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,940
Once again one sixth.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,030
The same holds for 3 4 5 and 6.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,880
Now what is the probability of getting a 7.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,830
It is impossible to get a 7 when rolling a die.

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,580
Therefore the probability is zero.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,710
The distribution of an event consists not only of the input values that can be observed but is made

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,010
up of all the possible values.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,660
So the distribution of the event rolling a die will be given by the following table.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:26,150
The probability of getting 1 is 0.17 the probability of getting 2 is 0.17 and so on.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,780
You are sure that you have exhausted all possible values when the sum of the probabilities is equal

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,230
to 100 percent for all other values.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,710
The probability of occurrence is zero.

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,070
Each probability distribution is associated with a graph describing the likelihood of occurrence of

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,320
every event.

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,880
Here's the graph for our example.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
This type of distribution is called uniform distribution.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,420
It is crucial to understand that the distribution is defined by the underlying probabilities and not

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
the graph.

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,310
The graph is just a visual representation.

32
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,110
All right.

33
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,660
Now think about rolling two dice.

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:13,960
What are the possibilities 1 and 1 2 and 1 1 and 2 and so on.

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,360
Here's a table with all the possible combinations.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,470
We are interested in the sum of two dice.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,910
So what's the probability of getting a sum of 1 0 as this event is impossible.

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,750
What's the probability of getting a sum of two.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,180
There is only one combination that would give us the sum of two when both dice are equal to 1.

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:45,190
So 1 out of 36 total outcomes or zero point zero or three Similarily the probability of getting a sum

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,080
of three is given by the number of combinations that give a sum of three divided by 36.

42
00:02:51,220 --> 00:03:00,680
Therefore two divided by 36 or 0.06 we continue this way until we have the full probability distribution.

43
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,430
Let's see the graph associated with it.

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,690
All right so looking at it we understand that when we roll two dice the probability of getting a seven

45
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,070
is the highest.

46
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:17,010
We can also compare different outcomes such as the probability of getting a 10 and the probability of

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,070
getting a 5.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,950
It's evident that it's less likely that we'll get a 10 grade.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,030
The examples that we saw here were of discrete variables.

50
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,120
Next we will focus on continuous distributions as they are more common in inferences.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,340
In the next few lessons we'll examine some of the main types of continuous distributions starting with

52
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,630
the normal distribution.

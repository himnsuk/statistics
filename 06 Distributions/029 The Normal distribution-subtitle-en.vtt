00:00.700 --> 00:08.170
OK here we go so far we learned that the distribution of a data set shows us the frequency I wish possible

00:08.170 --> 00:10.350
values occur within an interval.

00:10.600 --> 00:17.050
We also said that there are dozens of distributions experienced statisticians can immediately distinguish

00:17.080 --> 00:23.230
a binomial from a porcelain distribution as well as a uniform from an exponential distribution in a

00:23.230 --> 00:30.900
quick glimpse at a plot in this course though we will rather focus on the normal and students distributions

00:30.910 --> 00:39.280
due to the following reasons they approximate a wide variety of random variables distributions of sample

00:39.340 --> 00:46.330
mean with large enough sample sizes could be approximated to normal all computable statistics are elegant

00:47.140 --> 00:52.020
decisions based on normal distribution insites have a good track record.

00:52.250 --> 00:58.500
If it sounds like gibberish now I promise that things will be much easier once we get started.

00:58.550 --> 01:03.050
Here is a visual representation of a normal distribution.

01:03.170 --> 01:08.330
You have surely seen a normal distribution before as it is the most common one.

01:08.360 --> 01:14.060
The statistical term for it is gone in distribution but many people call it the bell curve as it is

01:14.060 --> 01:15.650
shaped like a bell.

01:15.710 --> 01:20.060
It is symmetrical and its mean median and mode are equal.

01:20.060 --> 01:25.190
If you remember the lesson about skewness you would recognize that it has no skew.

01:25.190 --> 01:32.090
It is perfectly centered around its mean Alright so it is denoted in this way.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.990
N stands for normal.

01:34.090 --> 01:39.280
The tilde assigned denotes it is a distribution and in brackets we have the mean and the variance of

01:39.280 --> 01:41.750
the distribution on the plane.

01:41.770 --> 01:47.890
You can notice that the highest point is located at the mean because it coincides with the mode.

01:48.190 --> 01:52.720
The spread of the graph is determined by the standard deviation.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.740
Now let's try to understand the normal distribution a little bit better.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.450
Let's look at this approximately normal distribution histogram.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.820
There is a concentration of the observations around the mean which makes sense as it is equal to the

02:06.820 --> 02:07.480
mode.

02:07.780 --> 02:12.490
Moreover it is symmetrical on both sides of the mean.

02:12.550 --> 02:16.310
We used 80 observations to create this histogram.

02:16.360 --> 02:23.010
It's mean is 743 and its standard deviation is 140 OK.

02:23.060 --> 02:27.220
Great but what if the mean is smaller or bigger.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.990
Let's zoom out a bit by adding the origin of the graph.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.270
The origin is the zero point.

02:33.530 --> 02:36.190
Adding it to any graph gives perspective.

02:36.350 --> 02:42.500
Keeping the standard deviation fixed or in statistical jargon controlling for the standard deviation

02:42.590 --> 02:46.100
a lower mean would result in the same shape of the distribution.

02:46.130 --> 02:53.040
But on the left side of the plane in the same way a bigger mean would move the graph to the right.

02:53.120 --> 03:00.860
In our example this resulted in two new distributions one with the mean of 470 and a standard deviation

03:00.860 --> 03:07.840
of one hundred forty and one with a mean of 960 and a standard deviation of hundred forty.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.520
All right.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.640
Let's do the opposite controlling for the mean.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.340
We can change the standard deviation and see what happens this time.

03:16.410 --> 03:23.080
The graph is not moving but is rather reshaping a lower standard deviation results in lower dispersion.

03:23.100 --> 03:29.850
So more data in the middle and thinner tails on the other hand a higher standard deviation will cause

03:29.850 --> 03:33.760
the graph to fly now with less points in the middle and more to the end.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.590
Or in statistics jargon fatter tails great.

03:38.680 --> 03:43.500
In our next lesson we will use this knowledge to talk about standardization.

03:43.510 --> 03:44.590
Stay tuned.

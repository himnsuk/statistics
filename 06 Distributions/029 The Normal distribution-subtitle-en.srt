1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,170
OK here we go so far we learned that the distribution of a data set shows us the frequency I wish possible

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,350
values occur within an interval.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,050
We also said that there are dozens of distributions experienced statisticians can immediately distinguish

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,230
a binomial from a porcelain distribution as well as a uniform from an exponential distribution in a

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,900
quick glimpse at a plot in this course though we will rather focus on the normal and students distributions

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:39,280
due to the following reasons they approximate a wide variety of random variables distributions of sample

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,330
mean with large enough sample sizes could be approximated to normal all computable statistics are elegant

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,020
decisions based on normal distribution insites have a good track record.

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,500
If it sounds like gibberish now I promise that things will be much easier once we get started.

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,050
Here is a visual representation of a normal distribution.

11
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,330
You have surely seen a normal distribution before as it is the most common one.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,060
The statistical term for it is gone in distribution but many people call it the bell curve as it is

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,650
shaped like a bell.

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,060
It is symmetrical and its mean median and mode are equal.

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,190
If you remember the lesson about skewness you would recognize that it has no skew.

16
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:32,090
It is perfectly centered around its mean Alright so it is denoted in this way.

17
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,990
N stands for normal.

18
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,280
The tilde assigned denotes it is a distribution and in brackets we have the mean and the variance of

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,750
the distribution on the plane.

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,890
You can notice that the highest point is located at the mean because it coincides with the mode.

21
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,720
The spread of the graph is determined by the standard deviation.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,740
Now let's try to understand the normal distribution a little bit better.

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,450
Let's look at this approximately normal distribution histogram.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,820
There is a concentration of the observations around the mean which makes sense as it is equal to the

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,480
mode.

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,490
Moreover it is symmetrical on both sides of the mean.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,310
We used 80 observations to create this histogram.

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,010
It's mean is 743 and its standard deviation is 140 OK.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,220
Great but what if the mean is smaller or bigger.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,990
Let's zoom out a bit by adding the origin of the graph.

31
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,270
The origin is the zero point.

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,190
Adding it to any graph gives perspective.

33
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,500
Keeping the standard deviation fixed or in statistical jargon controlling for the standard deviation

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,100
a lower mean would result in the same shape of the distribution.

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:53,040
But on the left side of the plane in the same way a bigger mean would move the graph to the right.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,860
In our example this resulted in two new distributions one with the mean of 470 and a standard deviation

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,840
of one hundred forty and one with a mean of 960 and a standard deviation of hundred forty.

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,520
All right.

39
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,640
Let's do the opposite controlling for the mean.

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,340
We can change the standard deviation and see what happens this time.

41
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:23,080
The graph is not moving but is rather reshaping a lower standard deviation results in lower dispersion.

42
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,850
So more data in the middle and thinner tails on the other hand a higher standard deviation will cause

43
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,760
the graph to fly now with less points in the middle and more to the end.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,590
Or in statistics jargon fatter tails great.

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,500
In our next lesson we will use this knowledge to talk about standardization.

46
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,590
Stay tuned.

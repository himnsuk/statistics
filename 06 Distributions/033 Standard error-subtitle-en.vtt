00:00.710 --> 00:06.480
In the previous lesson we showed that no matter the underlying distribution of the data set the distribution

00:06.480 --> 00:12.000
of the sample means would be normal with the mean equal to the original mean and variance equal to the

00:12.000 --> 00:15.490
original variance divided by the sample size.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.320
All right.

00:16.410 --> 00:22.180
This lecture will be very short and has the sole purpose of defining what a standard error is.

00:22.470 --> 00:28.680
The standard error is the standard deviation of the distribution formed by the sample means.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.340
So how do we find it.

00:30.370 --> 00:31.690
We know it's variants.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.160
Sigma squared divided by n.

00:34.270 --> 00:41.580
Therefore the standard deviation is Sigma divided by the square root of N like a standard deviation.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.070
The standard error shows variability.

00:44.230 --> 00:50.020
In this case it is the variability of the means of the different samples we extracted.

00:50.020 --> 00:52.600
You can guess that since the term has its own name.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.120
It is widely used and very important.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.510
Why is it important.

00:57.790 --> 01:03.760
Well it is used for almost all statistical tests because it shows you how well you approximated the

01:03.760 --> 01:04.690
true mean.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.380
More on that in the next lessons.

01:07.730 --> 01:11.470
Know that it decreases as the sample size increases.

01:11.470 --> 01:16.940
This makes sense as bigger samples give a better approximation of the population.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.070
That's all for now.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.000
Thanks for watching.

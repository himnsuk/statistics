00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,390
The standard normal distribution is a particular case of the normal distribution we'll use the letter

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,870
Z to denote it.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,000
It has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the standard normal distribution is easy to understand

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,240
and has several important applications.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:24,090
Every normal distribution can be standardized standardization in this context is the process of turning

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,500
a normally distributed variable to one with a standard normal distribution.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,720
A simple formula allows us to do that.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,870
The standardized variable the variable whose normal distribution we are turning into a standard normal

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,780
distribution is called a z score it is equal to the original variable minus its mean divided by its

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,720
standard deviation.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,360
Let's try to interpret it first.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,200
We have to look at the numerator.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,260
If you take a dataset subtract its mean from each data point and then calculate the mean.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,130
Once again you will get zero.

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,820
The following example will help us prove that.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:10,720
Let's take an approximately normally distributed set of numbers 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 and 5.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,460
Its mean is 3 and its standard deviation 1.2 2.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,790
Now lets have tracked the mean from all data points.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,980
We get a new dataset of minus two minus 1 minus 1 0 0 0 1 1 and 2.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,560
Let's calculate the mean.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,160
It is 0 exactly as we anticipated.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,840
Clear.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,650
OK great.

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,540
So far we have a new distribution which is still normal but with a mean of zero.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,710
Any standard deviation of 1.2 to the next step of standardization is to divide all data points by the

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,210
standard deviation.

27
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,550
This will drive the standard deviation of the new data set to 1.

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,450
Let's go back to our example.

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,850
Both the original data set and the one we obtained after subtracting the mean from each data point have

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,000
a standard deviation of 1.2 to remember.

31
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,330
Adding and subtracting to all data points does not change the standard deviation.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:23,800
Now let's divide each data point by 1.2 to we get minus 1.6 3 minus 0.8 to minus 0.8 to 0 0 0 0.8 to

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,970
zero point a two and 1.6 three.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,520
If we calculate the standard deviation of this dataset we will get one and the mean is still zero.

35
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,840
Let's quickly show that cool.

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,320
This is how we can obtain a standard normal distribution from any normally distributed data set.

37
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,230
Using it makes predictions and inference much easier.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,970
And this will help us a great deal in what we will see next.

39
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,990
Thanks for watching.

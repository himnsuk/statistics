Now that we have covered the basics of descriptive statistics it is time to move on to inferential statistics

00:07.640 --> 00:13.860
inferential statistics refers to methods that rely on probability theory and distributions in particular

00:13.950 --> 00:17.690
to predict population values based on sample data.

00:17.700 --> 00:23.430
While this definition may not be clear just yet starting from the next lesson we will define what a

00:23.430 --> 00:28.720
distribution is and we'll go through a couple of distributions you will likely use at work.

00:28.740 --> 00:34.490
This will naturally lead us to point estimates and we will conclude the section with confidence intervals.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.990
We will not only present these topics but will also develop a deep understanding of the statistical

00:39.990 --> 00:41.190
processes.

00:41.190 --> 00:45.360
This will help you a great deal if you get into data science.

00:45.380 --> 00:50.270
I recommend you complete all the exercises provided as they will reveal additional subjects you will

00:50.270 --> 00:56.180
be in charge of researching these insights will likely be your gateway to the fundamentals of quantitative

00:56.180 --> 00:58.630
research and data driven decision making.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.730
Finally to get you more hyped about what's to come.

01:02.840 --> 01:08.300
You to me the world's most popular e-learning Web site was making decisions about its strategy based

01:08.300 --> 01:11.090
on the methodology that's to follow in this section.

01:11.830 --> 01:14.300
Good luck with the lessons and have fun.

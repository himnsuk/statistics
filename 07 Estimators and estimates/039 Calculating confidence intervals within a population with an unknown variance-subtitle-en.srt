1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,150
All right.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,810
So we've learned that confidence intervals based on small samples from normally distributed populations

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,190
are calculated with the t statistic.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,080
Let's revisit the example we saw earlier.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,500
You are an aspiring did a scientist and are wondering how much the mean data scientists salary is you

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,960
have a sample of nine compensations you found on glass door and you have summarized the information

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,410
in the following table.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,570
OK.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,880
We've already calculated the sample mean and standard error which are ninety two thousand five hundred

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,380
thirty three dollars and four thousand six hundred forty four dollars respectively.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,600
But this time we don't have one key piece of information.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,840
The population variance.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,130
No problem.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,800
As the good statisticians that we are we will use the Student's t distribution.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,200
Here's the formula that allows us to find a confidence interval for the mean of a population with an

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,530
unknown variance.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,660
Let's compare it with the formula we used when the variance is known.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,960
There are two key differences.

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:13,180
First instead of Z statistic we have a t statistic and second instead of population standard deviation

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,790
we have sample standard deviation.

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:24,010
Otherwise everything is the same so it shouldn't be that difficult to remember the logic behind constructing

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,140
confidence intervals.

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,400
In both cases is the same.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,330
The only two inputs that change are the statistic at hand and the standard deviation when population

25
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,510
variance is known.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,760
Population standard deviation goes with the Z statistic.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,850
When population variance is unknown.

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,840
Several standard deviation goes with the t statistic.

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,460
All right so we have the sample mean standard deviation and sample size.

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,530
All we have to do is find the t statistic.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,170
We will be able to obtain the t statistic from the tea table.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,690
First we need to specify the degrees of freedom for the Student's t distribution.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,410
There are n minus 1 degrees of freedom.

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,340
Our sample consists of nine observations.

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,270
So we have eight degrees of freedom.

36
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,200
Second we have to find Alpha divided by two.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,030
Once again this depends on the confidence level that we want to obtain.

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,930
In this example we are going to use a confidence level of 95 percent.

39
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,690
This means that Alpha is equal to 5 percent.

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,170
Therefore half of Alpha would be 2.5 percent.

41
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,810
You can now see that the associated t statistic is 2.3 1 great.

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,050
Note that some tables you will find in books or online like this one have a C row.

43
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,080
The abbreviation stands for confidence interval.

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,810
Instead of finding Alpha we can just check the 95 percent confidence interval and get the same result.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,110
Easy OK.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,680
We have all the information needed so we just plug in the numbers.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,490
What we get is a confidence interval from eighty one thousand eight hundred six dollars to one hundred

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,270
three thousand $261.

49
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,070
Let's compare this result to the result for the confidence interval with known population.

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,320
We got a 95 percent confidence interval that was between ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,770
dollars and one hundred five thousand five hundred sixty eight dollars.

52
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,450
You can clearly note that when we know the population variance we get a narrower confidence interval.

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,400
When we do not know the population variance there is a higher uncertainty that is reflected by wider

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,530
boundaries for our interval.

55
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,070
Makes sense doesn't it.

56
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,090
So what we learned today is that even when we do not know the population variance we can still make

57
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,090
predictions but they will be less accurate.

58
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,520
Furthermore the proper statistic for estimating the confidence interval when the population variance

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,370
is unknown is the t statistic and not the Z statistic.

60
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,780
All right great.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,970
Thanks for watching.

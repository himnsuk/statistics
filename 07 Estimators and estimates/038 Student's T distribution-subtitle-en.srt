00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,820
It's time for a short break from all these numbers and calculations I would like to tell you a story.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,160
William Gosset was an English statistician who worked for the brewery of Guinness.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,680
He developed different methods for the selection of the best yielding varieties of barley an important

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,300
ingredient when making beer Gosset found big samples tedious.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,700
So he was trying to develop a way to extract small samples but still come up with meaningful predictions.

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,040
He was a curious and productive researcher and published a number of papers that are still relevant

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,020
today.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,120
However due to the Guinness company policy he was not allowed to sign the papers with his own name.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,560
Therefore all of his work was under the pen name student.

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,460
Later on a friend of his and a famous statistician Ronald Fischer stepping on the findings of Gosset

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,670
introduced the t statistic and the name that stuck with the corresponding distribution even today is

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,880
students t the Student's t distribution is one of the biggest breakthroughs in statistics as it allowed

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,560
inference through small samples with an unknown population variance.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,050
This sitting can be applied to a big part of statistical problems we face today and is an important

15
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,980
part of this course.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,150
All right visually the Student's t distribution looks much like a normal distribution but generally

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,950
has fatter tails fatter tails.

18
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,560
As you may remember allows for a higher dispersion of variables as there is more uncertainty in the

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,960
same way that the Z statistic is related to the standard normal distribution.

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,190
The statistic is related to the Student's t distribution.

21
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:51,340
The formula that allows us to calculate it is t with and minus 1 degrees of freedom any significance

22
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,490
level of Alpha equals the sample mean minus the population mean divided by the standard error of the

23
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,370
sample.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,590
As you can see it is very similar to the Z statistic.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,080
After all this is an approximation of the normal distribution.

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,520
The last characteristic of the Student's t statistic is that there are degrees of freedom.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,270
Usually for a sample of N we have n minus 1 degrees of freedom.

28
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,460
So for a sample of 20 observations the degrees of freedom are 19.

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,040
Much like the standard normal distribution table.

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,710
We also have a students tea table.

31
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,880
Here it is.

32
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,740
The rows indicate different degrees of freedom.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,390
Abbreviated as D F while the columns common Alfas.

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,130
Please note that after the 30th row the numbers don't vary that much.

35
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,980
Actually after 30 degrees of freedom the statistic table becomes almost the same as the Z statistic

36
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,310
as the degrees of freedom depend on the sample.

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,350
In essence the bigger the sample the closer we get to the actual numbers.

38
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,260
A common rule of thumb is that for a simple containing more than 50 observations we use the Z table

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,840
instead of the tea table.

40
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,560
All right great.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,310
In our next lecture we will apply our knowledge.

42
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,180
In practice.

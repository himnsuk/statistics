00:00.440 --> 00:01.150
All right.

00:01.290 --> 00:06.810
So we've learned that confidence intervals based on small samples from normally distributed populations

00:06.900 --> 00:10.190
are calculated with the t statistic.

00:10.230 --> 00:13.080
Let's revisit the example we saw earlier.

00:13.200 --> 00:19.500
You are an aspiring did a scientist and are wondering how much the mean data scientists salary is you

00:19.500 --> 00:24.960
have a sample of nine compensations you found on glass door and you have summarized the information

00:24.960 --> 00:26.410
in the following table.

00:26.730 --> 00:27.570
OK.

00:27.570 --> 00:32.880
We've already calculated the sample mean and standard error which are ninety two thousand five hundred

00:32.880 --> 00:37.380
thirty three dollars and four thousand six hundred forty four dollars respectively.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.600
But this time we don't have one key piece of information.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.840
The population variance.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.130
No problem.

00:45.390 --> 00:50.800
As the good statisticians that we are we will use the Student's t distribution.

00:51.010 --> 00:56.200
Here's the formula that allows us to find a confidence interval for the mean of a population with an

00:56.260 --> 00:58.530
unknown variance.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.660
Let's compare it with the formula we used when the variance is known.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.960
There are two key differences.

01:04.990 --> 01:13.180
First instead of Z statistic we have a t statistic and second instead of population standard deviation

01:13.480 --> 01:15.790
we have sample standard deviation.

01:15.910 --> 01:24.010
Otherwise everything is the same so it shouldn't be that difficult to remember the logic behind constructing

01:24.010 --> 01:25.140
confidence intervals.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.400
In both cases is the same.

01:27.400 --> 01:34.330
The only two inputs that change are the statistic at hand and the standard deviation when population

01:34.330 --> 01:35.510
variance is known.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.760
Population standard deviation goes with the Z statistic.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.850
When population variance is unknown.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.840
Several standard deviation goes with the t statistic.

01:45.850 --> 01:51.460
All right so we have the sample mean standard deviation and sample size.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.530
All we have to do is find the t statistic.

01:54.850 --> 01:59.170
We will be able to obtain the t statistic from the tea table.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.690
First we need to specify the degrees of freedom for the Student's t distribution.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.410
There are n minus 1 degrees of freedom.

02:07.450 --> 02:10.340
Our sample consists of nine observations.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.270
So we have eight degrees of freedom.

02:13.270 --> 02:17.200
Second we have to find Alpha divided by two.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.030
Once again this depends on the confidence level that we want to obtain.

02:22.030 --> 02:26.930
In this example we are going to use a confidence level of 95 percent.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.690
This means that Alpha is equal to 5 percent.

02:30.700 --> 02:35.170
Therefore half of Alpha would be 2.5 percent.

02:35.170 --> 02:40.810
You can now see that the associated t statistic is 2.3 1 great.

02:40.810 --> 02:47.050
Note that some tables you will find in books or online like this one have a C row.

02:47.140 --> 02:50.080
The abbreviation stands for confidence interval.

02:50.080 --> 02:55.810
Instead of finding Alpha we can just check the 95 percent confidence interval and get the same result.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.110
Easy OK.

02:59.290 --> 03:03.680
We have all the information needed so we just plug in the numbers.

03:03.850 --> 03:09.490
What we get is a confidence interval from eighty one thousand eight hundred six dollars to one hundred

03:09.490 --> 03:12.270
three thousand $261.

03:12.730 --> 03:18.070
Let's compare this result to the result for the confidence interval with known population.

03:18.070 --> 03:23.320
We got a 95 percent confidence interval that was between ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three

03:23.320 --> 03:27.770
dollars and one hundred five thousand five hundred sixty eight dollars.

03:27.820 --> 03:33.450
You can clearly note that when we know the population variance we get a narrower confidence interval.

03:33.940 --> 03:39.400
When we do not know the population variance there is a higher uncertainty that is reflected by wider

03:39.400 --> 03:41.530
boundaries for our interval.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.070
Makes sense doesn't it.

03:44.030 --> 03:50.090
So what we learned today is that even when we do not know the population variance we can still make

03:50.090 --> 03:53.090
predictions but they will be less accurate.

03:53.130 --> 03:58.520
Furthermore the proper statistic for estimating the confidence interval when the population variance

03:58.520 --> 04:03.370
is unknown is the t statistic and not the Z statistic.

04:03.380 --> 04:04.780
All right great.

04:04.940 --> 04:05.970
Thanks for watching.

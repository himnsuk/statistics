1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,900
High again in the previous lesson we learned about point estimators.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,180
But as you can guess they are not very reliable.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,880
Imagine visiting 5 percent of the restaurants in London and saying that the average meal is worth fifty

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,360
pounds.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,400
You may be close but chances are that the true value is it really twenty two point fifty but somewhere

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,230
around it it's much safer to say that the average meal in London is somewhere between 20 and 25 pounds

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,380
isn't it.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:38,230
In this way you have created a confidence interval around your point estimate of 20 2.50 a confidence

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,130
interval is a much more accurate representation of reality.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,010
However there is still some uncertainty left which we measure in levels of confidence.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,630
So getting back to our example you may say that you are 95 percent confident that the population parameter

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,910
lies between 20 and 25 quid.

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,190
Keep in mind that you can never be 100 percent confident unless you go through the entire population

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,060
and there is of course a 5 percent chance that the actual population parameter is outside of the 20

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,200
to 25 pounds range.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,720
We'll observe that if the sample we have considered deviate significantly from the entire population.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,780
All right.

18
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,210
There is one more ingredient needed.

19
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:32,490
The level of confidence it is denoted by one minus Alpha and is called the confidence level of the interval

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,990
Alpha is a value between 0 and 1.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,610
For example if we want to be 95 percent confident that the parameter is inside the interval Alpha is

22
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,170
5 percent.

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,500
If we want a higher confidence level say 99 percent Alpha will be 1 percent.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,690
Don't worry we will discuss this in more detail in our next video.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,580
You can't wait until the next lesson.

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,770
Ok then here it is.

27
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,090
The formula for all confidence intervals is from the point estimate minus the reliability factor times

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,620
the standard error to the point estimate Plus the reliability factor times the standard error.

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,840
We know that the point estimate is values like X bar and S Bar right.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,110
We also know what the standard error is one about the reliability factor.

31
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,810
We'll have to introduce in our next lesson.

1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,740
OK great let's continue.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,100
By introducing the concept of an estimator of a population parameter it is an approximation depending

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,720
solely on sample information a specific value is called an estimate.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,990
There are two types of estimates point estimates and confidence interval estimates of point estimate

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,380
is a single number.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:32,050
While a confidence interval naturally is an interval the two are closely related.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,880
In fact the point estimate is located exactly in the middle of the confidence interval.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,360
However confidence intervals provide much more information and are preferred when making inferences.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,030
All right have we seen estimates so far.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,090
Sure we have the sample mean X bar is a point estimate of the population mean mue.

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,680
Moreover the sample variance as squared was an estimate of the population variance Sigma squared.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,680
There may be many estimators for the same variable.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,540
However they all have two properties.

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,620
Bias and efficiency.

15
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,500
We will not prove them as the mathematics associated is out of the score of this course.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,660
However you should have an idea about the concepts estimators are like judges.

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,670
We are always looking for the most efficient unbiased estimators an unbiased estimator has an expected

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,600
value equal to the population parameter.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,330
Let's think of a biased estimator to explain that point.

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,030
What if somebody told you that you will have to find the average height of Americans by taking a sample

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,860
finding its mean and then adding one foot to that result.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,950
So the formula is X bar plus 1 foot.

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,760
Well I hope you won't trust them.

24
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,310
They gave you an estimator but a biased one.

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,550
It makes much more sense that the average height of Americans is approximated just by the sample mean.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,630
Right.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,700
We say that the bias of this estimator is 1 foot clear.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,100
OK great.

29
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,490
Let's move on to efficiency.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,200
The most efficient estimators are the ones with the least variability of outcomes from the estimates

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,180
we know so far we haven't seen estimators with problematic variants.

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,430
So it is hard to exemplify.

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,190
It is enough to know that the most efficient means the unbiased estimator with the smallest variance.

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,490
All right in the next lecture we will explore confidence intervals.

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,380
So stick around.

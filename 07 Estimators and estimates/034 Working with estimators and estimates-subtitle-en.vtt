00:00.980 --> 00:03.740
OK great let's continue.

00:03.740 --> 00:10.100
By introducing the concept of an estimator of a population parameter it is an approximation depending

00:10.100 --> 00:15.720
solely on sample information a specific value is called an estimate.

00:16.540 --> 00:23.990
There are two types of estimates point estimates and confidence interval estimates of point estimate

00:24.080 --> 00:25.380
is a single number.

00:25.430 --> 00:32.050
While a confidence interval naturally is an interval the two are closely related.

00:32.060 --> 00:37.880
In fact the point estimate is located exactly in the middle of the confidence interval.

00:37.950 --> 00:44.360
However confidence intervals provide much more information and are preferred when making inferences.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.030
All right have we seen estimates so far.

00:47.030 --> 00:54.090
Sure we have the sample mean X bar is a point estimate of the population mean mue.

00:54.350 --> 01:01.680
Moreover the sample variance as squared was an estimate of the population variance Sigma squared.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.680
There may be many estimators for the same variable.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.540
However they all have two properties.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.620
Bias and efficiency.

01:09.730 --> 01:14.500
We will not prove them as the mathematics associated is out of the score of this course.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.660
However you should have an idea about the concepts estimators are like judges.

01:20.790 --> 01:27.670
We are always looking for the most efficient unbiased estimators an unbiased estimator has an expected

01:27.670 --> 01:30.600
value equal to the population parameter.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.330
Let's think of a biased estimator to explain that point.

01:34.660 --> 01:40.030
What if somebody told you that you will have to find the average height of Americans by taking a sample

01:40.300 --> 01:43.860
finding its mean and then adding one foot to that result.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.950
So the formula is X bar plus 1 foot.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.760
Well I hope you won't trust them.

01:50.830 --> 01:54.310
They gave you an estimator but a biased one.

01:54.340 --> 01:59.550
It makes much more sense that the average height of Americans is approximated just by the sample mean.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.630
Right.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.700
We say that the bias of this estimator is 1 foot clear.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.100
OK great.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.490
Let's move on to efficiency.

02:10.260 --> 02:16.200
The most efficient estimators are the ones with the least variability of outcomes from the estimates

02:16.200 --> 02:20.180
we know so far we haven't seen estimators with problematic variants.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.430
So it is hard to exemplify.

02:22.530 --> 02:29.190
It is enough to know that the most efficient means the unbiased estimator with the smallest variance.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.490
All right in the next lecture we will explore confidence intervals.

02:33.510 --> 02:34.380
So stick around.

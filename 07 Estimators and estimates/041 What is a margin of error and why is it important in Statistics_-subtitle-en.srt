00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,690
Welcome back in the last few lessons we've been concentrating on confidence intervals.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,520
We learned about two situations when the population variance is known which happens very rarely in practice

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,840
and when the variance is unknown and follows a Student's t distribution the goal of this lesson is less

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,180
about learning and more about clarifying alright.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,930
These are the formulas that allow us to find confidence intervals as we noted in our previous lecture.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,170
These parts are the ones that determine the span of the confidence interval.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,270
There is a special name for these expressions.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,050
Margin of error.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,130
When the population variance is known the margin of error is equal to this expression and in the case

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,880
of population variance unknown the margin of error is equal to this expression instead.

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,260
So basically the confidence intervals could be summarized as follows.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,500
The true population mean falls in the interval defined by the sample mean plus minus the margin of error.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,300
Now we get to the core of this lesson.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,260
Getting a smaller margin of error means that the confidence interval would be narrower as we want a

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,390
better prediction.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,210
It is in our interest to have the narrowest possible confidence interval.

17
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,090
The best part is that we can actually control the margin of error.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,910
Let's see its parts.

19
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,950
There is a statistic a stair deviation and the sample size the statistic and the standard deviation

20
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,440
are in the numerator so smaller statistic and smaller standard deviations will reduce the margin of

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,760
error.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,900
How do we do that a higher level of confidence increases the statistic a higher statistic means a higher

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,120
margin of error.

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,340
This leads to a wider confidence interval.

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,860
Think about this example you took an exam and you want to make your prediction about the mean grade

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,600
obtained by all exam takers as a b c d and f are all possible grades.

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,990
We are 100 percent confident that the mean grade will be in the confidence interval from F to A.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,380
Now if we lower the confidence level to 99 percent we may end up with a confidence interval from F plus

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,840
to a minus.

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:26,550
Remember the interpretation in 99 percent of the cases the population mean falls in the interval.

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,700
So with a 50 percent confidence level in 50 percent of the cases the true mean will fall in the specified

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,080
interval.

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,060
The only scenario under which this is possible is if the interval is narrower.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,540
Therefore if the standard deviation and the sample size are kept constant a lower confidence level will

35
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,480
result in a narrower interval.

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,860
What about the standard deviation.

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,340
That's easy.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,960
A lower standard deviation means that the dataset is more concentrated around the mean.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,110
So we have a better chance to get it right.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,900
For instance the mean grade in your class is B and you know that there were people with A's PC's DS

41
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,460
and a few F's.

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,100
How likely is it that you got a B.

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,520
Now compare this to a situation when the teacher said the mean of the class is around B and the lowest

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,320
grade is c..

45
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:27,280
In this case you are much more likely to get a B right in the first case the grades are dispersed while

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,740
in the second they are concentrated.

47
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:38,270
Lastly we have the sample size in the denominator higher sample sizes will decrease the margin of error.

48
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,550
This is also quite intuitive.

49
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,500
The more observations you have in your sample the more certain you are in the prediction.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,950
This time you have a B plus there are 30 people in the class and you want to know if you performed above

51
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,690
the average you ask three of your friends and they all got A's.

52
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,930
Your sample of three people leads you to think you underperformed.

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,970
You get frustrated and start asking around some more the next 5 people you ask got Ds.

54
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,390
Now you have a sample of 8 people and it seems you did quite well.

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:19,100
After asking everyone in class the whole population that is you find out that the mean grade is B you

56
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,310
are above average by a small margin.

57
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,440
The conclusion is that the more observations there are in the sample the higher the chances of getting

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,890
a good idea about the true mean of the entire population.

59
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,980
All right.

60
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,670
Hopefully this clears up some doubts you may have had.

61
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,690
Thanks for watching.

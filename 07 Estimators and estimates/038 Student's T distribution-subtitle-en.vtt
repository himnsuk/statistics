00:00.890 --> 00:07.820
It's time for a short break from all these numbers and calculations I would like to tell you a story.

00:07.850 --> 00:13.160
William Gosset was an English statistician who worked for the brewery of Guinness.

00:13.160 --> 00:18.680
He developed different methods for the selection of the best yielding varieties of barley an important

00:18.680 --> 00:23.300
ingredient when making beer Gosset found big samples tedious.

00:23.360 --> 00:29.700
So he was trying to develop a way to extract small samples but still come up with meaningful predictions.

00:30.670 --> 00:36.040
He was a curious and productive researcher and published a number of papers that are still relevant

00:36.040 --> 00:37.020
today.

00:37.090 --> 00:43.120
However due to the Guinness company policy he was not allowed to sign the papers with his own name.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.560
Therefore all of his work was under the pen name student.

00:48.010 --> 00:54.460
Later on a friend of his and a famous statistician Ronald Fischer stepping on the findings of Gosset

00:54.670 --> 01:00.670
introduced the t statistic and the name that stuck with the corresponding distribution even today is

01:00.670 --> 01:07.880
students t the Student's t distribution is one of the biggest breakthroughs in statistics as it allowed

01:07.970 --> 01:12.560
inference through small samples with an unknown population variance.

01:12.560 --> 01:18.050
This sitting can be applied to a big part of statistical problems we face today and is an important

01:18.050 --> 01:19.980
part of this course.

01:20.010 --> 01:26.150
All right visually the Student's t distribution looks much like a normal distribution but generally

01:26.150 --> 01:28.950
has fatter tails fatter tails.

01:28.970 --> 01:35.560
As you may remember allows for a higher dispersion of variables as there is more uncertainty in the

01:35.560 --> 01:39.960
same way that the Z statistic is related to the standard normal distribution.

01:39.970 --> 01:44.190
The statistic is related to the Student's t distribution.

01:44.290 --> 01:51.340
The formula that allows us to calculate it is t with and minus 1 degrees of freedom any significance

01:51.340 --> 01:57.490
level of Alpha equals the sample mean minus the population mean divided by the standard error of the

01:57.490 --> 01:58.370
sample.

01:58.780 --> 02:02.590
As you can see it is very similar to the Z statistic.

02:02.620 --> 02:07.080
After all this is an approximation of the normal distribution.

02:07.240 --> 02:12.520
The last characteristic of the Student's t statistic is that there are degrees of freedom.

02:12.700 --> 02:18.270
Usually for a sample of N we have n minus 1 degrees of freedom.

02:18.310 --> 02:24.460
So for a sample of 20 observations the degrees of freedom are 19.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.040
Much like the standard normal distribution table.

02:27.130 --> 02:29.710
We also have a students tea table.

02:29.710 --> 02:30.880
Here it is.

02:31.030 --> 02:33.740
The rows indicate different degrees of freedom.

02:33.820 --> 02:39.390
Abbreviated as D F while the columns common Alfas.

02:39.460 --> 02:44.130
Please note that after the 30th row the numbers don't vary that much.

02:44.200 --> 02:50.980
Actually after 30 degrees of freedom the statistic table becomes almost the same as the Z statistic

02:51.730 --> 02:54.310
as the degrees of freedom depend on the sample.

02:54.340 --> 02:59.350
In essence the bigger the sample the closer we get to the actual numbers.

02:59.410 --> 03:05.260
A common rule of thumb is that for a simple containing more than 50 observations we use the Z table

03:05.320 --> 03:07.840
instead of the tea table.

03:07.870 --> 03:09.560
All right great.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.310
In our next lecture we will apply our knowledge.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.180
In practice.

00:00.660 --> 00:07.470
A confidence interval is the range within which you expect the population parameter to be and its estimation

00:07.470 --> 00:10.360
is based on the data we have in our sample.

00:10.410 --> 00:16.500
There are two main situations when we can calculate the confidence intervals for a population when the

00:16.500 --> 00:22.980
population variance is known and when it is unknown depending on which situation we are in we would

00:22.980 --> 00:25.610
use a different calculation method.

00:25.790 --> 00:31.700
In this lesson we will explore the confidence intervals for a population mean with a known variance

00:32.790 --> 00:38.700
an important assumption and this calculation is that the population is normally distributed even if

00:38.700 --> 00:39.450
it is not.

00:39.480 --> 00:45.250
You should use a large sample and let the Central Limit Theorem do the normalization magic for you.

00:45.270 --> 00:53.180
Remember if you work with a sample which is large enough you can assume normality of sample means Alright.

00:53.400 --> 00:58.850
Let's say you want to become a data scientist and you are interested in the salary you're going to get.

00:58.860 --> 01:04.900
You are also aware that population standard deviation of data science salaries is equal to fifteen thousand

01:04.890 --> 01:06.300
dollars.

01:06.330 --> 01:12.840
Furthermore you know the salaries are normally distributed and your sample consists of 30 salary's.

01:12.940 --> 01:18.910
The formula for the confidence interval with a known variance is given below the population mean will

01:18.910 --> 01:27.700
fall between the sample mean minus Z of Alpha divided by two times the standard error and the sample

01:27.700 --> 01:35.900
mean plus Z of Alpha divided by two times the standard error the sample mean is the point estimator.

01:35.910 --> 01:38.100
You know all about the standard error already.

01:38.100 --> 01:41.240
So let's compute it using the formula.

01:41.260 --> 01:50.680
What we have left is the so called reliability factor Z of Alpha divided by two Z is the statistic that

01:50.680 --> 01:52.390
we've described earlier.

01:52.480 --> 01:57.880
The standardized variable that has a standard normal distribution right.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.710
And what about Alpha.

01:59.710 --> 02:03.960
This is the same alpha we had when we defined our confidence level.

02:04.030 --> 02:10.070
So for a confidence level of 95 percent Alpha would be equal to 5 percent.

02:10.270 --> 02:16.780
Similarily for a confidence level of 99 percent Alpha would be equal to 1 percent.

02:16.780 --> 02:18.160
It all falls into place.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.520
Now let's get back to our example.

02:21.970 --> 02:27.700
The sample mean is one hundred thousand two hundred dollars and the standard deviation is known to be

02:27.700 --> 02:29.460
fifteen thousand dollars.

02:29.470 --> 02:34.430
Thus the standard error is two thousand seven hundred thirty nine dollars.

02:34.600 --> 02:41.500
Having calculated these values we can take the next step and choose our confidence level calm and confidence

02:41.500 --> 02:49.600
levels are 90 percent 95 percent and 99 percent with respective Alfas of 10 percent 5 percent and 1

02:49.600 --> 02:50.850
percent.

02:50.860 --> 02:58.410
Another way to put in the value of alpha is 0.1 0.05 and 0.01 respectively.

02:58.420 --> 03:04.060
Keep in mind that a 95 percent confidence interval means that you are sure that in 95 percent of the

03:04.060 --> 03:08.830
cases the true population parameter would fall into the specified interval.

03:09.840 --> 03:16.300
The CSY of Alpha comes from the so-called standard normal distribution table it is best to first see

03:16.300 --> 03:17.990
it and then comment on it.

03:18.250 --> 03:25.710
Let's say we want to find the values for the 95 percent confidence interval Alpha is 0.05.

03:25.840 --> 03:34.060
Therefore we are looking for Z of Alpha divided by two or zero point zero to five in this table.

03:34.180 --> 03:42.550
This will match the value of one minus zero point zero to five or zero point nine seventy five the corresponding

03:42.550 --> 03:47.740
z comes from the sum of the row and column table headers associated with the cell.

03:47.860 --> 03:54.440
In our case the value is one point nine plus 0.06 or 1.9 six.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.660
A commonly used term for the z is critical value.

03:58.660 --> 04:04.130
So we have found the critical value for this confidence interval.

04:04.130 --> 04:07.220
Now we can easily substitute in the formula.

04:07.430 --> 04:12.590
The final confidence interval becomes ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three to one hundred

04:12.590 --> 04:15.390
five thousand five hundred sixty eight.

04:15.410 --> 04:17.850
The interpretation is the following.

04:17.990 --> 04:23.700
We are 95 percent confident that the average data scientists salary will be in the interval.

04:23.720 --> 04:28.700
Ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three and one hundred five thousand five hundred sixty eight

04:28.700 --> 04:29.470
dollars.

04:30.390 --> 04:34.120
Let's repeat the exercise using a higher confidence level.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.250
Say we want to be 99 percent certain of the outcome.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.070
Alpha is zero point zero one.

04:41.250 --> 04:49.110
We look at the table for the value of one minus 0.00 five which is equal to zero point nine nine five.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.940
Bummer there is no such value.

04:51.990 --> 04:58.380
When this happens we just have to round to the nearest value available the corresponding critical value

04:58.530 --> 05:01.630
is 2.5 plus zero point zero or eight.

05:01.720 --> 05:09.180
Thus 2.5 8 we plug it into our formula once more and the new confidence interval is equal to ninety

05:09.180 --> 05:14.370
three thousand one hundred thirty five and one hundred seven thousand two hundred six.

05:14.370 --> 05:20.160
This means that we are 99 percent confident that the average data scientists salary is going to lie

05:20.160 --> 05:25.260
in the interval between ninety three thousand one hundred thirty five and one hundred seven thousand

05:25.260 --> 05:28.120
two hundred six dollars.

05:28.130 --> 05:34.190
Please note that in this case there is a tradeoff between the level of confidence we chose and the estimation

05:34.190 --> 05:38.110
precision the interval we obtained is broader.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.190
The opposite is also true.

05:40.490 --> 05:45.710
A narrow confidence interval translate to higher uncertainty makes sense right.

05:46.610 --> 05:52.430
If we are trying to estimate the population mean and we are picking a larger interval we are increasing

05:52.430 --> 05:58.640
our chances of having an interval that actually includes the mean and vice versa.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.080
If we want to be more specific about the population mean range.

06:02.080 --> 06:07.190
This will take away from our confidence about this statement OK.

06:07.270 --> 06:11.020
This lecture was a bit longer but very insightful.

06:11.260 --> 06:17.470
Don't skip the exercises provided they will help you reinforce the knowledge about this concept which

06:17.470 --> 06:21.590
is fundamental for everybody who wants to work with numbers in their job.

06:22.460 --> 06:28.220
In the next few lessons we will study some particular cases and teach you how to find confidence intervals

06:28.220 --> 06:29.360
for them.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.320
Thanks for watching.

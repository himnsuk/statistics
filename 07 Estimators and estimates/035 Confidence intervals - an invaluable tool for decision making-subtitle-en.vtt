00:01.100 --> 00:05.900
High again in the previous lesson we learned about point estimators.

00:05.900 --> 00:09.180
But as you can guess they are not very reliable.

00:09.230 --> 00:14.880
Imagine visiting 5 percent of the restaurants in London and saying that the average meal is worth fifty

00:14.880 --> 00:16.360
pounds.

00:16.550 --> 00:22.400
You may be close but chances are that the true value is it really twenty two point fifty but somewhere

00:22.400 --> 00:29.230
around it it's much safer to say that the average meal in London is somewhere between 20 and 25 pounds

00:29.240 --> 00:30.380
isn't it.

00:30.380 --> 00:38.230
In this way you have created a confidence interval around your point estimate of 20 2.50 a confidence

00:38.230 --> 00:42.130
interval is a much more accurate representation of reality.

00:42.750 --> 00:48.010
However there is still some uncertainty left which we measure in levels of confidence.

00:48.030 --> 00:54.630
So getting back to our example you may say that you are 95 percent confident that the population parameter

00:54.720 --> 00:57.910
lies between 20 and 25 quid.

00:57.930 --> 01:04.190
Keep in mind that you can never be 100 percent confident unless you go through the entire population

01:04.980 --> 01:12.060
and there is of course a 5 percent chance that the actual population parameter is outside of the 20

01:12.060 --> 01:14.200
to 25 pounds range.

01:14.340 --> 01:20.720
We'll observe that if the sample we have considered deviate significantly from the entire population.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.780
All right.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.210
There is one more ingredient needed.

01:24.290 --> 01:32.490
The level of confidence it is denoted by one minus Alpha and is called the confidence level of the interval

01:33.530 --> 01:36.990
Alpha is a value between 0 and 1.

01:37.100 --> 01:43.610
For example if we want to be 95 percent confident that the parameter is inside the interval Alpha is

01:43.610 --> 01:45.170
5 percent.

01:45.170 --> 01:51.500
If we want a higher confidence level say 99 percent Alpha will be 1 percent.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.690
Don't worry we will discuss this in more detail in our next video.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.580
You can't wait until the next lesson.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.770
Ok then here it is.

02:01.110 --> 02:09.090
The formula for all confidence intervals is from the point estimate minus the reliability factor times

02:09.090 --> 02:16.620
the standard error to the point estimate Plus the reliability factor times the standard error.

02:16.620 --> 02:21.840
We know that the point estimate is values like X bar and S Bar right.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.110
We also know what the standard error is one about the reliability factor.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.810
We'll have to introduce in our next lesson.

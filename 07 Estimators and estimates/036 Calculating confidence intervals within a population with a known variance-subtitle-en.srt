1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,470
A confidence interval is the range within which you expect the population parameter to be and its estimation

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,360
is based on the data we have in our sample.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,500
There are two main situations when we can calculate the confidence intervals for a population when the

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,980
population variance is known and when it is unknown depending on which situation we are in we would

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,610
use a different calculation method.

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,700
In this lesson we will explore the confidence intervals for a population mean with a known variance

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,700
an important assumption and this calculation is that the population is normally distributed even if

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,450
it is not.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,250
You should use a large sample and let the Central Limit Theorem do the normalization magic for you.

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:53,180
Remember if you work with a sample which is large enough you can assume normality of sample means Alright.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,850
Let's say you want to become a data scientist and you are interested in the salary you're going to get.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,900
You are also aware that population standard deviation of data science salaries is equal to fifteen thousand

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,300
dollars.

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,840
Furthermore you know the salaries are normally distributed and your sample consists of 30 salary's.

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,910
The formula for the confidence interval with a known variance is given below the population mean will

16
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:27,700
fall between the sample mean minus Z of Alpha divided by two times the standard error and the sample

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,900
mean plus Z of Alpha divided by two times the standard error the sample mean is the point estimator.

18
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,100
You know all about the standard error already.

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,240
So let's compute it using the formula.

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:50,680
What we have left is the so called reliability factor Z of Alpha divided by two Z is the statistic that

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,390
we've described earlier.

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,880
The standardized variable that has a standard normal distribution right.

23
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,710
And what about Alpha.

24
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,960
This is the same alpha we had when we defined our confidence level.

25
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,070
So for a confidence level of 95 percent Alpha would be equal to 5 percent.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,780
Similarily for a confidence level of 99 percent Alpha would be equal to 1 percent.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,160
It all falls into place.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,520
Now let's get back to our example.

29
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,700
The sample mean is one hundred thousand two hundred dollars and the standard deviation is known to be

30
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,460
fifteen thousand dollars.

31
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,430
Thus the standard error is two thousand seven hundred thirty nine dollars.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,500
Having calculated these values we can take the next step and choose our confidence level calm and confidence

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:49,600
levels are 90 percent 95 percent and 99 percent with respective Alfas of 10 percent 5 percent and 1

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,850
percent.

35
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:58,410
Another way to put in the value of alpha is 0.1 0.05 and 0.01 respectively.

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,060
Keep in mind that a 95 percent confidence interval means that you are sure that in 95 percent of the

37
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,830
cases the true population parameter would fall into the specified interval.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,300
The CSY of Alpha comes from the so-called standard normal distribution table it is best to first see

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,990
it and then comment on it.

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,710
Let's say we want to find the values for the 95 percent confidence interval Alpha is 0.05.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,060
Therefore we are looking for Z of Alpha divided by two or zero point zero to five in this table.

42
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:42,550
This will match the value of one minus zero point zero to five or zero point nine seventy five the corresponding

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,740
z comes from the sum of the row and column table headers associated with the cell.

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,440
In our case the value is one point nine plus 0.06 or 1.9 six.

45
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,660
A commonly used term for the z is critical value.

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,130
So we have found the critical value for this confidence interval.

47
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,220
Now we can easily substitute in the formula.

48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,590
The final confidence interval becomes ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three to one hundred

49
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,390
five thousand five hundred sixty eight.

50
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,850
The interpretation is the following.

51
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,700
We are 95 percent confident that the average data scientists salary will be in the interval.

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,700
Ninety four thousand eight hundred thirty three and one hundred five thousand five hundred sixty eight

53
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,470
dollars.

54
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,120
Let's repeat the exercise using a higher confidence level.

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,250
Say we want to be 99 percent certain of the outcome.

56
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,070
Alpha is zero point zero one.

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:49,110
We look at the table for the value of one minus 0.00 five which is equal to zero point nine nine five.

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,940
Bummer there is no such value.

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,380
When this happens we just have to round to the nearest value available the corresponding critical value

60
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,630
is 2.5 plus zero point zero or eight.

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,180
Thus 2.5 8 we plug it into our formula once more and the new confidence interval is equal to ninety

62
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,370
three thousand one hundred thirty five and one hundred seven thousand two hundred six.

63
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,160
This means that we are 99 percent confident that the average data scientists salary is going to lie

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,260
in the interval between ninety three thousand one hundred thirty five and one hundred seven thousand

65
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,120
two hundred six dollars.

66
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,190
Please note that in this case there is a tradeoff between the level of confidence we chose and the estimation

67
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,110
precision the interval we obtained is broader.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,190
The opposite is also true.

69
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,710
A narrow confidence interval translate to higher uncertainty makes sense right.

70
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,430
If we are trying to estimate the population mean and we are picking a larger interval we are increasing

71
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,640
our chances of having an interval that actually includes the mean and vice versa.

72
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,080
If we want to be more specific about the population mean range.

73
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,190
This will take away from our confidence about this statement OK.

74
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,020
This lecture was a bit longer but very insightful.

75
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,470
Don't skip the exercises provided they will help you reinforce the knowledge about this concept which

76
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,590
is fundamental for everybody who wants to work with numbers in their job.

77
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,220
In the next few lessons we will study some particular cases and teach you how to find confidence intervals

78
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,360
for them.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
Thanks for watching.

00:00.420 --> 00:02.870
Hi and welcome back.

00:03.030 --> 00:05.220
This is the main section of this course.

00:05.340 --> 00:08.110
It is based on the knowledge that you acquired previously.

00:08.130 --> 00:11.460
So if you haven't been through it you may have a hard time keeping up.

00:12.410 --> 00:18.400
Make sure you have seen all the videos about confidence intervals distribution's the tables and tea

00:18.400 --> 00:21.520
tables and have done all the exercises.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.570
If you've completed them already you are good to go.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.200
Confidence Intervals provide us with an estimation of where the parameters are located.

00:30.210 --> 00:35.180
However when you are making a decision you need a yes or no answer.

00:35.190 --> 00:39.050
The correct approach in this case is to use a test.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.420
In this section we will learn how to perform one of the fundamental tasks in statistics.

00:44.450 --> 00:46.090
Hypothesis Testing.

00:46.550 --> 00:51.240
OK there are four steps in data driven decision making.

00:51.250 --> 00:55.540
First you must formulate a hypothesis second.

00:55.660 --> 01:00.960
Once you have formulated a hypothesis you will have to find the right test for your hypothesis.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.000
Third you execute the test.

01:04.610 --> 01:07.830
And fourth you make a decision based on the result.

01:08.910 --> 01:13.050
Let's start from the beginning what is a hypothesis.

01:13.050 --> 01:14.990
Though there are many ways to define it.

01:15.060 --> 01:21.190
The most intuitive I've seen is a hypothesis is an idea that can be tested.

01:21.270 --> 01:25.420
This is not the formal definition but it explains the point very well.

01:25.860 --> 01:29.390
So if I tell you that apples in New York are expensive.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.210
This is an idea or a statement but is not testable until I have something to compare it with.

01:35.220 --> 01:41.580
For instance if I define expensive as any price higher than one dollar and seventy five cents per pound

01:41.790 --> 01:44.450
then it immediately becomes a hypothesis.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.190
All right what.

01:46.270 --> 01:49.570
Something that cannot be tested with a hypothesis.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.260
An example may be.

01:51.310 --> 01:57.490
Would the USA do better or worse under a Clinton administration compared to a Trump administration.

01:57.490 --> 02:04.000
Statistically speaking this is an idea but there is no data to test it therefore it cannot be a hypothesis

02:04.060 --> 02:05.980
of a statistical test.

02:05.980 --> 02:10.220
Actually it is more likely to be a topic of another discipline.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.730
Conversely in statistics we may compare different U.S. presidencies that have already been completed

02:15.970 --> 02:19.620
such as the Obama administration and the Bush administration.

02:19.690 --> 02:22.060
As we have data on both.

02:22.170 --> 02:26.460
All right let's get out of politics and get into hypotheses.

02:26.740 --> 02:32.940
Here's a simple topic that can be tested according to Glassdoor the popular selling information Web

02:32.940 --> 02:39.850
site the mean data scientists cellaring the US is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars so we wanted

02:39.850 --> 02:42.020
to test if their estimate is correct.

02:42.790 --> 02:49.780
There are two hypotheses that are made the null hypothesis denoted h zero and the Alternative Hypothesis

02:49.960 --> 02:52.270
denoted h 1 or H.

02:52.840 --> 02:59.560
The null hypothesis is the one to be tested and the alternative is everything else in our example.

02:59.560 --> 03:05.890
The null hypothesis would be the mean data scientists salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars

03:06.280 --> 03:12.550
while the alternative the mean data scientists salary is not one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

03:12.610 --> 03:17.980
Now you would want to check if one hundred thirteen thousand is close enough to the true mean predicted

03:17.980 --> 03:23.240
by our sample in case it is you would accept the null hypothesis.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.950
Otherwise you would reject the null hypothesis.

03:27.010 --> 03:32.840
The concept of the null hypothesis is similar to innocent until proven guilty.

03:32.890 --> 03:38.960
We assume that the mean salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars and we try to prove otherwise.

03:39.900 --> 03:44.740
All right this was an example of a two sided or a two tailed test.

03:44.750 --> 03:51.250
You can also form one sided or OneTel tests say your friend Paul told you that he thinks data scientists

03:51.260 --> 03:54.390
are more than one hundred twenty five thousand dollars per year.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.690
You don't him so you design a test to see who is right.

03:58.790 --> 04:04.790
The null hypothesis of this test would be the mean data scientists salary is more than one hundred twenty

04:04.790 --> 04:06.700
five thousand dollars.

04:06.710 --> 04:09.090
The alternative will cover everything else.

04:09.170 --> 04:15.620
Thus the mean data scientists salary is less than or equal to one hundred twenty five thousand dollars.

04:16.730 --> 04:22.130
It is important to note that outcomes of tests refer to the population parameter rather than the sample

04:22.130 --> 04:24.210
statistic as such.

04:24.290 --> 04:32.170
The result that we get is for the population another crucial consideration is that generally the researcher

04:32.170 --> 04:34.960
is trying to reject the null hypothesis.

04:34.960 --> 04:40.930
Think about the null hypothesis as the status quo and the alternative as the change or innovation that

04:40.930 --> 04:42.810
challenges that status quo.

04:43.180 --> 04:49.270
In our example Paul was representing the status quo which we were challenging.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.110
All right.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.750
That's all for now in the next lectures.

04:52.770 --> 04:56.420
We'll see some examples and learn how to make data driven decisions.

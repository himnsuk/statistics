1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,930
High again.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,280
So you know what a hypothesis is and you have an idea of how to form the know and alternative hypotheses

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,270
in this lesson we all understand the reason why hypothesis testing works.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,800
Imagine that the actual average grade of all students in a UK university is 55 percent.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,640
The University Dean however believes that on average students obtain 70 percent.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,180
Of course you can't just agree with his opinion.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,610
So you start testing the hypothesis is the population mean grade is 70 percent.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,510
The alternative hypothesis is the population mean grade is different than 70 percent.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,860
So why does hypothesis testing work.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,130
We assume that the population of grades is normally distributed.

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,430
The true population mean is fifty five percent.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,140
The idea is to test if 70 percent is the true mean.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:04,920
Or in our example if 70 percent is close enough to 55 percent this part is called the rejection region.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:11,480
If the no hypothesis value is inside the rejection region you reject the null hypothesis.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,880
Now imagine that the old Dean who got fired recently told you that the mean grade is 56 percent.

16
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,530
In that case if you want to test his opinion the null hypothesis would be the population mean is equal

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,210
to 56 percent.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,070
This value is much closer to 55 percent and far away from the rejection region.

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,290
You will most likely accept the no hypothesis in statistical jargon.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,820
You cannot say that 56 percent is not the population mean this will all become clear soon enough.

21
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,330
There is one more important part of testing the significance level the significance level is denoted

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,350
by Alpha.

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,360
It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,390
The rejection region depends on the Alpha as pointed in the graph.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,910
Typical values for Alpha are zero point zero or 1 0.05 and zero point one.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,310
It is a value that you select based on the certainty you need.

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,930
In most cases the choice of Alpha is determined by the context you are operating in.

28
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,730
For example if you need to test if a machine is working properly you would expect it to make little

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,910
or no mistakes as you want to be very precise.

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,520
You should pick a low significance level such as 0.01 the famous Coca-Cola glass bottle is 12 ounces.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,720
If the machine pours twelve point one ounces some of the liquid will be spilled and the label will be

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,190
damaged as well.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,340
So in certain situations we need to be as accurate as possible.

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,320
However if we were analyzing human or company behavior we would expect a more random behavior and hence

35
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,060
a higher degree of error.

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,390
For example if we want to predict how much Coca-Cola consumers drink on average the difference between

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,930
12 ounces and twelve point one ounces will not be that crucial.

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,320
So we can choose a higher significance level alright.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,640
Our graph so far we're showing rejection reagents for two sided tests such as the one where we tested

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,300
whether our population mean is equal to 70 percent in these cases.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,700
The significance level Alpha is divided between the two sides of the normal distribution on the left.

42
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,580
We have a significance of Alpha divided by two.

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,480
And on the right we have another alpha divided by two.

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,490
This is due to the fact that the true mean could be either 55 percent or 85 percent in both cases.

45
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,190
We are equally likely to reject the null hypothesis but on a different side of the distribution What

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,190
about one tailed tests which look in the following way.

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,650
Is the mean lower than 70 percent.

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,600
And in each one is the mean higher or equal to 70 percent.

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,290
In this case the rejection region will only be on the right side with a significant level of alpha and

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,870
to complete the picture.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,430
Here's a plot of the third case defined by an age zero of the mean higher than 70 percent.

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,310
All right.

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,240
In a lesson or two we'll get to real life examples.

54
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,640
We are almost there.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,870
Just hold on a bit.

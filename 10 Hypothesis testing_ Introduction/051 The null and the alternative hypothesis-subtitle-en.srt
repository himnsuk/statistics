00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,870
Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,220
This is the main section of this course.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,110
It is based on the knowledge that you acquired previously.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,460
So if you haven't been through it you may have a hard time keeping up.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,400
Make sure you have seen all the videos about confidence intervals distribution's the tables and tea

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,520
tables and have done all the exercises.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,570
If you've completed them already you are good to go.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,200
Confidence Intervals provide us with an estimation of where the parameters are located.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,180
However when you are making a decision you need a yes or no answer.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,050
The correct approach in this case is to use a test.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,420
In this section we will learn how to perform one of the fundamental tasks in statistics.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,090
Hypothesis Testing.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,240
OK there are four steps in data driven decision making.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,540
First you must formulate a hypothesis second.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,960
Once you have formulated a hypothesis you will have to find the right test for your hypothesis.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,000
Third you execute the test.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,830
And fourth you make a decision based on the result.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,050
Let's start from the beginning what is a hypothesis.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,990
Though there are many ways to define it.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,190
The most intuitive I've seen is a hypothesis is an idea that can be tested.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,420
This is not the formal definition but it explains the point very well.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,390
So if I tell you that apples in New York are expensive.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,210
This is an idea or a statement but is not testable until I have something to compare it with.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,580
For instance if I define expensive as any price higher than one dollar and seventy five cents per pound

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,450
then it immediately becomes a hypothesis.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,190
All right what.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,570
Something that cannot be tested with a hypothesis.

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,260
An example may be.

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,490
Would the USA do better or worse under a Clinton administration compared to a Trump administration.

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,000
Statistically speaking this is an idea but there is no data to test it therefore it cannot be a hypothesis

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,980
of a statistical test.

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,220
Actually it is more likely to be a topic of another discipline.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,730
Conversely in statistics we may compare different U.S. presidencies that have already been completed

34
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,620
such as the Obama administration and the Bush administration.

35
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,060
As we have data on both.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,460
All right let's get out of politics and get into hypotheses.

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,940
Here's a simple topic that can be tested according to Glassdoor the popular selling information Web

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,850
site the mean data scientists cellaring the US is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars so we wanted

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,020
to test if their estimate is correct.

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,780
There are two hypotheses that are made the null hypothesis denoted h zero and the Alternative Hypothesis

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,270
denoted h 1 or H.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,560
The null hypothesis is the one to be tested and the alternative is everything else in our example.

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,890
The null hypothesis would be the mean data scientists salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,550
while the alternative the mean data scientists salary is not one hundred thirteen thousand dollars.

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,980
Now you would want to check if one hundred thirteen thousand is close enough to the true mean predicted

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,240
by our sample in case it is you would accept the null hypothesis.

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,950
Otherwise you would reject the null hypothesis.

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,840
The concept of the null hypothesis is similar to innocent until proven guilty.

49
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,960
We assume that the mean salary is one hundred thirteen thousand dollars and we try to prove otherwise.

50
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,740
All right this was an example of a two sided or a two tailed test.

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,250
You can also form one sided or OneTel tests say your friend Paul told you that he thinks data scientists

52
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,390
are more than one hundred twenty five thousand dollars per year.

53
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,690
You don't him so you design a test to see who is right.

54
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,790
The null hypothesis of this test would be the mean data scientists salary is more than one hundred twenty

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,700
five thousand dollars.

56
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,090
The alternative will cover everything else.

57
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,620
Thus the mean data scientists salary is less than or equal to one hundred twenty five thousand dollars.

58
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,130
It is important to note that outcomes of tests refer to the population parameter rather than the sample

59
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,210
statistic as such.

60
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:32,170
The result that we get is for the population another crucial consideration is that generally the researcher

61
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,960
is trying to reject the null hypothesis.

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,930
Think about the null hypothesis as the status quo and the alternative as the change or innovation that

63
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,810
challenges that status quo.

64
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,270
In our example Paul was representing the status quo which we were challenging.

65
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,110
All right.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,750
That's all for now in the next lectures.

67
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,420
We'll see some examples and learn how to make data driven decisions.

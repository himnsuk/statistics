00:00.630 --> 00:01.930
High again.

00:02.070 --> 00:08.280
So you know what a hypothesis is and you have an idea of how to form the know and alternative hypotheses

00:09.280 --> 00:14.270
in this lesson we all understand the reason why hypothesis testing works.

00:14.440 --> 00:19.800
Imagine that the actual average grade of all students in a UK university is 55 percent.

00:20.140 --> 00:25.640
The University Dean however believes that on average students obtain 70 percent.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.180
Of course you can't just agree with his opinion.

00:28.210 --> 00:35.610
So you start testing the hypothesis is the population mean grade is 70 percent.

00:35.610 --> 00:41.510
The alternative hypothesis is the population mean grade is different than 70 percent.

00:41.550 --> 00:44.860
So why does hypothesis testing work.

00:44.910 --> 00:49.130
We assume that the population of grades is normally distributed.

00:49.270 --> 00:52.430
The true population mean is fifty five percent.

00:52.570 --> 00:56.140
The idea is to test if 70 percent is the true mean.

00:56.200 --> 01:04.920
Or in our example if 70 percent is close enough to 55 percent this part is called the rejection region.

01:05.020 --> 01:11.480
If the no hypothesis value is inside the rejection region you reject the null hypothesis.

01:11.480 --> 01:17.880
Now imagine that the old Dean who got fired recently told you that the mean grade is 56 percent.

01:17.930 --> 01:24.530
In that case if you want to test his opinion the null hypothesis would be the population mean is equal

01:24.530 --> 01:26.210
to 56 percent.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.070
This value is much closer to 55 percent and far away from the rejection region.

01:32.420 --> 01:37.290
You will most likely accept the no hypothesis in statistical jargon.

01:37.310 --> 01:44.820
You cannot say that 56 percent is not the population mean this will all become clear soon enough.

01:44.820 --> 01:51.330
There is one more important part of testing the significance level the significance level is denoted

01:51.330 --> 01:52.350
by Alpha.

01:52.410 --> 01:57.360
It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.390
The rejection region depends on the Alpha as pointed in the graph.

02:01.440 --> 02:07.910
Typical values for Alpha are zero point zero or 1 0.05 and zero point one.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.310
It is a value that you select based on the certainty you need.

02:11.580 --> 02:16.930
In most cases the choice of Alpha is determined by the context you are operating in.

02:16.940 --> 02:22.730
For example if you need to test if a machine is working properly you would expect it to make little

02:22.730 --> 02:26.910
or no mistakes as you want to be very precise.

02:26.910 --> 02:34.520
You should pick a low significance level such as 0.01 the famous Coca-Cola glass bottle is 12 ounces.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.720
If the machine pours twelve point one ounces some of the liquid will be spilled and the label will be

02:39.720 --> 02:41.190
damaged as well.

02:41.190 --> 02:45.340
So in certain situations we need to be as accurate as possible.

02:46.140 --> 02:52.320
However if we were analyzing human or company behavior we would expect a more random behavior and hence

02:52.350 --> 02:54.060
a higher degree of error.

02:54.360 --> 03:00.390
For example if we want to predict how much Coca-Cola consumers drink on average the difference between

03:00.390 --> 03:03.930
12 ounces and twelve point one ounces will not be that crucial.

03:03.930 --> 03:08.320
So we can choose a higher significance level alright.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.640
Our graph so far we're showing rejection reagents for two sided tests such as the one where we tested

03:14.640 --> 03:19.300
whether our population mean is equal to 70 percent in these cases.

03:19.320 --> 03:25.700
The significance level Alpha is divided between the two sides of the normal distribution on the left.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.580
We have a significance of Alpha divided by two.

03:28.590 --> 03:32.480
And on the right we have another alpha divided by two.

03:32.520 --> 03:39.490
This is due to the fact that the true mean could be either 55 percent or 85 percent in both cases.

03:39.570 --> 03:46.190
We are equally likely to reject the null hypothesis but on a different side of the distribution What

03:46.190 --> 03:49.190
about one tailed tests which look in the following way.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.650
Is the mean lower than 70 percent.

03:52.860 --> 03:57.600
And in each one is the mean higher or equal to 70 percent.

03:57.660 --> 04:04.290
In this case the rejection region will only be on the right side with a significant level of alpha and

04:04.300 --> 04:05.870
to complete the picture.

04:05.870 --> 04:12.430
Here's a plot of the third case defined by an age zero of the mean higher than 70 percent.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.310
All right.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.240
In a lesson or two we'll get to real life examples.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.640
We are almost there.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.870
Just hold on a bit.

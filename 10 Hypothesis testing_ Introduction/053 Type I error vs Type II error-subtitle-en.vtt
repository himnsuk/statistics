00:00.460 --> 00:05.900
In this lesson we will learn about the errors that can be made in hypothesis testing.

00:05.900 --> 00:11.010
In general we can have two types of errors type 1 error and type 2 error.

00:11.090 --> 00:15.560
Sounds a bit boring but this will be a fun lecture I promise.

00:15.560 --> 00:22.320
First we will define the problems and then we will see some interesting examples type 1 error is when

00:22.320 --> 00:26.180
you reject a true null hypothesis and is the more serious error.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.920
It is also called a false positive.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.100
The probability of making this error is alpha.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.740
The level of significance since you the researcher choose the alpha.

00:36.810 --> 00:43.580
The responsibility for making this error lies solely on you type 2 error is when you accept a false

00:43.580 --> 00:45.230
null hypothesis.

00:45.230 --> 00:52.010
The probability of making this error is denoted by beda beda depends mainly on sample size and population

00:52.010 --> 00:52.980
variance.

00:53.060 --> 00:59.120
So if your topic is difficult to test due to a hard sampling or as high variability it is more likely

00:59.120 --> 01:01.000
to make this type of error.

01:01.130 --> 01:05.410
As you can imagine if the data set is hard to test it is not your fault.

01:05.460 --> 01:09.220
So Type 2 error is considered a smaller problem.

01:09.250 --> 01:14.830
We should also mention that the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis is equal to 1 minus

01:14.830 --> 01:15.860
beta.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.830
This is the researchers go to reject a false null hypothesis.

01:20.830 --> 01:25.620
Therefore one minus Bayda is called The Power of the test.

01:25.660 --> 01:31.360
Generally researchers increase the power of a test by increasing the sample size.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.790
This is a common table statisticians used to summarize the types of errors.

01:36.790 --> 01:42.870
Now let's see an example that I heard from my professor back when I was studying statistics in university.

01:42.970 --> 01:47.970
You're in love with this girl from the other class but are unsure if she likes you.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.070
There are two errors you can make.

01:50.140 --> 01:56.150
First if she likes you back and you don't invite her out you are making the type 1 error.

01:56.170 --> 02:00.470
The null hypothesis in this situation is she likes you back.

02:00.490 --> 02:03.010
It turns out that she really did like you back.

02:03.340 --> 02:08.980
Unfortunately you did not invite her out because after testing the situation you wrongly thought the

02:08.980 --> 02:11.200
null hypothesis was false.

02:11.200 --> 02:16.210
In other words you rejected a true null hypothesis and lost her chance.

02:16.210 --> 02:22.270
It is a very serious problem because you could have been made for each other but you didn't even try.

02:22.270 --> 02:28.370
Now imagine another situation she doesn't like you back but you go and invite her out.

02:28.420 --> 02:33.460
The null hypothesis is still she likes you back but this time it is false.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.440
In reality she doesn't really like you back.

02:35.440 --> 02:43.130
That is however after testing you accept the null hypotheses and wrongly go and invite her out.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.270
She tells you that she has a boyfriend that is much older smarter and better at statistics than you

02:48.330 --> 02:50.000
and turns her back.

02:50.010 --> 02:54.890
You made a type 2 error accepted a false null hypothesis.

02:54.990 --> 02:59.910
However it is no big deal as you go back to your normal life without her and soon forget about this

02:59.910 --> 03:01.800
awkward situation.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.370
Hypothesis Testing is usually like that.

03:04.530 --> 03:08.560
You don't really want to make any of the two errors but it happens sometimes.

03:08.670 --> 03:13.620
You should be aware that statistics is very useful but not perfect.

03:13.810 --> 03:14.570
All right.

03:14.630 --> 03:18.860
That's all from our love slash life slash statistics lesson.

03:18.860 --> 03:19.780
Thanks for watching.

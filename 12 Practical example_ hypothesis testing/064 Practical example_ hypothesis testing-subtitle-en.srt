00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,380
Hello and welcome to our third practical example this time we will explore the topic of gender pay gap.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,920
We will test whether a particular company is discriminating against some of its employees on a gender

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,080
basis.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,950
Our fictitious company is called Sparke fortress incorporated.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,370
It is a big company with more than 5000 employees.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,270
And here we will work with a sample of one hundred seventy four of them.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:37,810
We have data showing us their name age gender nationality ethnicity tenure Department position and annual

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,090
salary.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,340
I believe there is no need for further explanation of the data set.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,140
We are going to test if there is a significant difference in the salaries.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,020
Employees are paid based on their gender.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,680
It would be easier if we looked at the problem at hand.

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,700
In the following way our 174 employees sample can be divided into two sub samples one that is exclusively

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,170
male and one female.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:10,460
So we have two samples drawn from the same population which are independent although so far we've worked

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,130
with different populations only if the values in one sample reveal no information about the other sample

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,180
then they are considered independent.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,590
There are different methodologies to conduct such a study and while regression analysis is my preferred

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,190
one we will have to wait until the next section for that here.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,580
We will use a hypothesis test for the mean salary to determine if there is reasonable evidence of gender

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,570
discrimination let's state the two hypotheses age zero.

22
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:51,290
The average male salary is equal to the average female salary or myu F-minus me f equal zero H-1 the

23
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,140
average male salary differs from the average female salary OK.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,030
The test we should use is the t test for independent samples.

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,980
What about the salary population variance.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,640
It is a known and we can assume it has equal let's construct a frequency distribution table.

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,300
We have 98 females and 76 males.

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,610
These are our sample sizes.

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,300
Next we should calculate the means and the sample variances of the two samples that we have as we assume

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,550
that the population variances are equal.

31
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,260
We should also compute the pooled variance.

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,940
Here's the good old formula and here's the ginormous results.

33
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,830
Finally the score for this test is computed following the familiar expression.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,190
We get a score of 1.3 for the degrees of freedom are one hundred seventy two as we said earlier.

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,800
Once we have surpassed 50 degrees of freedom the Student's t distribution almost completely overlaps

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
with the normal distribution.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Thus the p values for a score of 1.3 for an a z score of 1.3 for will be virtually the same you already

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,780
know how to use a p value calculator.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,150
So I'll just give you the p value.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,710
It's 0.1 8 to the p value is much greater than all common levels of significance.

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,830
We conclude that we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

42
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,390
There isn't enough statistical evidence that there is a wage gap in this firm.

43
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,430
Now that's cool.

44
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,180
Sparke fortress seems like a nice place to work at.

45
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,400
But let's dig just a bit deeper into this result.

46
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,280
Personally I'd be interested to know if there is no wage gap at all.

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,960
Or maybe there is one hidden beneath the aggregate values we just investigated.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,040
Sometimes it is a good idea to examine the data set manually.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,230
That's something we didn't do in the beginning but we should have done let's order the salaries from

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,780
largest to the smallest we can see that the highest paid employee is actually the president and CEO

51
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,790
of the company.

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Caroline bulled who is female.

53
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,680
This may explain the gelateria and culture of the company but it may also mean that her high salary

54
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,960
biased our data.

55
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,420
What if on average it seems that women are rewarded the same as men but in fact very few of them are

56
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,810
in such cases.

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,780
I would normally further segment the data lets divide the employees into two more groups below 35 and

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,400
above 35.

59
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,450
This will give us valuable information about the wage equality of younger and older staff.

60
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,820
I've created two more data sets that are based on the original one.

61
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,250
Let's run the same tests as before but this time we will do it on our segmented data.

62
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,690
The hypotheses are the same.

63
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:00,170
What we get for these two tests is a score of 0.4 3 for employees below 35 and 2.00 for employees over

64
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,190
35.

65
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,610
The corresponding p values are 0.6 x 8 and zero point zero for eight.

66
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:14,490
What these numbers mean is that in the group below 35 there is virtually no wage gap on a gender basis.

67
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,520
The p value is so big that we made sure there is no discrimination going on in the older group however

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,960
the p value is zero point zero for eight.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,020
This is very close to 0.05 but still below it.

70
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,160
This implies that at a 95 percent significance we reject the null hypothesis.

71
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,870
Therefore a wage gap does exist for older employees.

72
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,800
All right.

73
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,710
This was a two sided test.

74
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,770
So we are not sure who gets more money right.

75
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,570
Well do you remember the nifty trick the score of 2 is positive.

76
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,210
Therefore the difference in pay is positive in favor of males.

77
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,590
A limitation for this analysis is that we omitted other factors such as position and ethnicity.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,150
So we are not completely sure what's going on in the firm but we can say that overall there is no wage

79
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,630
gap and Sparke fortress.

80
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,340
And this is driven by wage equality among young employees.

81
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,190
This is a good indicator as it means that the company is firmly moving towards complete equality.

82
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,330
All right.

83
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,520
Your homework is to conduct a similar test that aims to capture if there is racial discrimination in

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,300
the firm.

85
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,410
You can find the data in the resources for this lesson.

86
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,530
Good luck and thanks for watching.

Hello and welcome to our third practical example this time we will explore the topic of gender pay gap.

00:08.520 --> 00:13.920
We will test whether a particular company is discriminating against some of its employees on a gender

00:13.920 --> 00:15.080
basis.

00:15.510 --> 00:19.950
Our fictitious company is called Sparke fortress incorporated.

00:19.950 --> 00:23.370
It is a big company with more than 5000 employees.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.270
And here we will work with a sample of one hundred seventy four of them.

00:28.300 --> 00:37.810
We have data showing us their name age gender nationality ethnicity tenure Department position and annual

00:37.810 --> 00:39.090
salary.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.340
I believe there is no need for further explanation of the data set.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.140
We are going to test if there is a significant difference in the salaries.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.020
Employees are paid based on their gender.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.680
It would be easier if we looked at the problem at hand.

00:52.690 --> 01:00.700
In the following way our 174 employees sample can be divided into two sub samples one that is exclusively

01:00.700 --> 01:03.170
male and one female.

01:03.230 --> 01:10.460
So we have two samples drawn from the same population which are independent although so far we've worked

01:10.460 --> 01:16.130
with different populations only if the values in one sample reveal no information about the other sample

01:16.220 --> 01:19.180
then they are considered independent.

01:19.220 --> 01:24.590
There are different methodologies to conduct such a study and while regression analysis is my preferred

01:24.590 --> 01:29.190
one we will have to wait until the next section for that here.

01:29.220 --> 01:34.580
We will use a hypothesis test for the mean salary to determine if there is reasonable evidence of gender

01:34.580 --> 01:41.570
discrimination let's state the two hypotheses age zero.

01:41.570 --> 01:51.290
The average male salary is equal to the average female salary or myu F-minus me f equal zero H-1 the

01:51.290 --> 01:57.140
average male salary differs from the average female salary OK.

01:57.270 --> 02:01.030
The test we should use is the t test for independent samples.

02:02.180 --> 02:04.980
What about the salary population variance.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.640
It is a known and we can assume it has equal let's construct a frequency distribution table.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.300
We have 98 females and 76 males.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.610
These are our sample sizes.

02:18.360 --> 02:24.300
Next we should calculate the means and the sample variances of the two samples that we have as we assume

02:24.300 --> 02:26.550
that the population variances are equal.

02:26.550 --> 02:29.260
We should also compute the pooled variance.

02:29.670 --> 02:35.940
Here's the good old formula and here's the ginormous results.

02:35.970 --> 02:41.830
Finally the score for this test is computed following the familiar expression.

02:41.920 --> 02:50.190
We get a score of 1.3 for the degrees of freedom are one hundred seventy two as we said earlier.

02:50.220 --> 02:55.800
Once we have surpassed 50 degrees of freedom the Student's t distribution almost completely overlaps

02:55.800 --> 02:57.960
with the normal distribution.

02:57.960 --> 03:06.640
Thus the p values for a score of 1.3 for an a z score of 1.3 for will be virtually the same you already

03:06.640 --> 03:08.780
know how to use a p value calculator.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.150
So I'll just give you the p value.

03:11.500 --> 03:18.710
It's 0.1 8 to the p value is much greater than all common levels of significance.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.830
We conclude that we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

03:23.830 --> 03:28.390
There isn't enough statistical evidence that there is a wage gap in this firm.

03:28.390 --> 03:29.430
Now that's cool.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.180
Sparke fortress seems like a nice place to work at.

03:32.290 --> 03:35.400
But let's dig just a bit deeper into this result.

03:36.260 --> 03:40.280
Personally I'd be interested to know if there is no wage gap at all.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.960
Or maybe there is one hidden beneath the aggregate values we just investigated.

03:46.060 --> 03:50.040
Sometimes it is a good idea to examine the data set manually.

03:50.080 --> 03:56.230
That's something we didn't do in the beginning but we should have done let's order the salaries from

03:56.230 --> 04:02.780
largest to the smallest we can see that the highest paid employee is actually the president and CEO

04:02.780 --> 04:03.790
of the company.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.360
Caroline bulled who is female.

04:06.410 --> 04:12.680
This may explain the gelateria and culture of the company but it may also mean that her high salary

04:12.680 --> 04:14.960
biased our data.

04:14.980 --> 04:21.420
What if on average it seems that women are rewarded the same as men but in fact very few of them are

04:22.660 --> 04:23.810
in such cases.

04:23.820 --> 04:30.780
I would normally further segment the data lets divide the employees into two more groups below 35 and

04:30.780 --> 04:32.400
above 35.

04:32.490 --> 04:37.450
This will give us valuable information about the wage equality of younger and older staff.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.820
I've created two more data sets that are based on the original one.

04:42.930 --> 04:49.250
Let's run the same tests as before but this time we will do it on our segmented data.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.690
The hypotheses are the same.

04:51.770 --> 05:00.170
What we get for these two tests is a score of 0.4 3 for employees below 35 and 2.00 for employees over

05:00.170 --> 05:01.190
35.

05:01.250 --> 05:07.610
The corresponding p values are 0.6 x 8 and zero point zero for eight.

05:07.630 --> 05:14.490
What these numbers mean is that in the group below 35 there is virtually no wage gap on a gender basis.

05:14.500 --> 05:21.520
The p value is so big that we made sure there is no discrimination going on in the older group however

05:21.640 --> 05:24.960
the p value is zero point zero for eight.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.020
This is very close to 0.05 but still below it.

05:29.020 --> 05:34.160
This implies that at a 95 percent significance we reject the null hypothesis.

05:34.180 --> 05:38.870
Therefore a wage gap does exist for older employees.

05:38.910 --> 05:39.800
All right.

05:39.810 --> 05:41.710
This was a two sided test.

05:41.850 --> 05:44.770
So we are not sure who gets more money right.

05:45.620 --> 05:50.570
Well do you remember the nifty trick the score of 2 is positive.

05:50.570 --> 05:55.210
Therefore the difference in pay is positive in favor of males.

05:56.050 --> 06:01.590
A limitation for this analysis is that we omitted other factors such as position and ethnicity.

06:01.600 --> 06:07.150
So we are not completely sure what's going on in the firm but we can say that overall there is no wage

06:07.150 --> 06:08.630
gap and Sparke fortress.

06:08.680 --> 06:12.340
And this is driven by wage equality among young employees.

06:12.340 --> 06:18.190
This is a good indicator as it means that the company is firmly moving towards complete equality.

06:18.190 --> 06:19.330
All right.

06:19.390 --> 06:24.520
Your homework is to conduct a similar test that aims to capture if there is racial discrimination in

06:24.520 --> 06:25.300
the firm.

06:25.330 --> 06:28.410
You can find the data in the resources for this lesson.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.530
Good luck and thanks for watching.

00:00.740 --> 00:05.000
This lesson we'll introduce you to the three measures of central tendency.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.480
Don't be scared by the terminology we are talking about mean median and mode even if you are familiar

00:11.480 --> 00:12.530
with these terms.

00:12.530 --> 00:16.570
Please stick around as we will explore their upsides and shortfalls.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.620
Ready let's go.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.140
The first measure we will study is the mean.

00:21.200 --> 00:28.040
Also known as the simple average it is denoted by the Greek letter mue for a population an X bar for

00:28.040 --> 00:29.330
a sample.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.660
These notions will come in handy in the next section we can find the mean of a dataset by adding up

00:35.660 --> 00:40.860
all of its components and then dividing them by the number of components contained in the data set.

00:41.730 --> 00:47.160
The mean is the most common measure of central tendency but it has a huge downside.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.900
It is easily affected by outliers.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.720
Let's compare these two data sets.

00:53.740 --> 00:59.380
These are the prices of pizza at 11 different locations in New York City and 10 different locations

00:59.440 --> 01:00.440
in L.A..

01:00.520 --> 01:06.610
Let's calculate the means of the two data sets using the formula for the mean in NYC.

01:06.670 --> 01:12.950
We get $11 whereas for L.A. just 5.5 on average pizza.

01:12.970 --> 01:16.740
New York can't be twice as expensive as in L.A. right.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.880
Correct.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.350
The problem is that in our sample we have included one posh place in New York where they charge $66

01:24.380 --> 01:25.140
for a pizza.

01:25.240 --> 01:31.540
And this doubled to mean what we should take away from this example is that the mean is not enough to

01:31.540 --> 01:33.970
make definite conclusions.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.650
So how can we protect ourselves from this issue.

01:37.660 --> 01:44.800
You guessed it we can calculate the second measure the median the median is basically the middle number

01:44.810 --> 01:46.710
in an ordered dataset.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.410
Let's see how it works for our example.

01:49.540 --> 01:56.170
In order to calculate the median we have to order our dataset in ascending order the median of the dataset

01:56.290 --> 02:04.030
is the number at position end plus 1 divided by two in the ordered list where n is the number of observations

02:04.930 --> 02:12.370
therefore the median for NYC is at the 6 position or six dollars much closer to the observed prices

02:12.370 --> 02:14.280
than the mean of dollars right.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.560
What about L.A..

02:16.760 --> 02:24.560
We have just 10 observations in L.A. According to our formula the median is at position 5.5.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.800
In cases like this the median is the simple average of the numbers.

02:28.850 --> 02:31.150
Positions 5 and 6.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.350
Therefore the median of L.A. prices is five point five dollars.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.070
OK.

02:37.100 --> 02:42.410
We have seen that the median is not affected by extreme prices which is good when we have posh New York

02:42.410 --> 02:48.850
restaurants in a street pizza sample but we still don't get the full picture or the majority of restaurants

02:48.860 --> 02:51.370
low cost or average.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.640
We must introduce another measure the mode.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.000
The mode is the value that occurs most often.

02:59.150 --> 03:05.240
It can be used for numerical and categorical data but we will stick to our numerical example.

03:05.240 --> 03:11.570
After counting the frequencies of each value we find that the mode of New York pizza prices is $3.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.370
Now that's interesting.

03:13.370 --> 03:20.210
The most common price of pizza in NYC is just $3 but the mean and median led us to believe it was much

03:20.210 --> 03:29.570
more expensive OK let's do the same and find the mode of L.A. pizza prices from each price appears only

03:29.570 --> 03:30.370
once.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.010
How do we find the mode then.

03:32.330 --> 03:38.780
Well we say that there is no mode but can I say that there are 10 modes you may ask.

03:38.780 --> 03:44.300
Sure you can but it will be meaningless with 10 observations and an experienced statistician would never

03:44.300 --> 03:45.480
do that.

03:45.500 --> 03:51.190
In general you often have multiple modes usually two or three modes are tolerable.

03:51.260 --> 03:55.560
But more than that would defeat the purpose of finding a mode.

03:55.580 --> 04:02.840
There is one less question that we haven't answered which measure is best the NYC and L.A. example shows

04:02.840 --> 04:07.820
us that measures of central tendency should be used together rather than independently.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.820
Therefore there is no best.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.590
But using only one is definitely the worst.

04:13.630 --> 04:14.240
All right.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.080
Now you know about the mean median and mode.

04:17.170 --> 04:21.670
In our next video we will use that knowledge to talk about skewness.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.490
Stay tuned and thanks for watching.

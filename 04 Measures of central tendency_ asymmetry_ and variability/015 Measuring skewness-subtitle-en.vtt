00:00.720 --> 00:06.260
After exploring the measures of central tendency Let's move on to the measures of symmetry.

00:06.270 --> 00:10.410
The most commonly used tool to measure a symmetry is skewness.

00:10.410 --> 00:16.800
This is the formula to calculate it almost always you will use software that performs the calculation

00:16.800 --> 00:17.420
for you.

00:17.430 --> 00:24.620
So in this lesson we will not get into the computation but rather the meaning of skewness so skewness

00:24.620 --> 00:30.860
indicates whether the observations in a dataset are concentrated on one side skewness can be confusing

00:30.860 --> 00:31.730
at the beginning.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.800
So an example is in place.

00:34.220 --> 00:38.010
Remember frequency distribution tables from previous lectures.

00:38.060 --> 00:42.510
Here we have three data sets and their respective frequency distributions.

00:42.740 --> 00:47.630
We have also calculated the means medians and modes.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.960
The first data set has a mean of two point seventy nine and a median of two hence the mean is bigger

00:53.960 --> 00:55.330
than the median.

00:55.430 --> 00:59.940
We say that this is a positive or right skew from the graph.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.120
You can clearly see that the data points are concentrated on the left side.

01:04.310 --> 01:08.390
Note the direction of the skew is counter-intuitive.

01:08.390 --> 01:14.090
It does not depend on which side the line is leading to but rather to which side its tail is leading

01:14.090 --> 01:15.100
to.

01:15.170 --> 01:20.620
So right skewness means that the outliers are to the right.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.160
It is interesting to see the measures of central tendency incorporated in the graph when we have the

01:26.160 --> 01:31.800
right skewness the mean is bigger than the median and the mode is the value with the highest visual

01:31.800 --> 01:35.390
representation in the second graph.

01:35.450 --> 01:42.320
We have plotted a data set that has an equal mean median and mode the frequency of occurrence is completely

01:42.320 --> 01:46.280
symmetrical and we call this a zero or no skew.

01:46.280 --> 01:52.950
Most often you'll hear people say that the distribution is symmetrical for the third dataset.

01:53.070 --> 02:00.440
We have a mean of 4.9 a median of five and a mode of six as the mean is lower than the median.

02:00.510 --> 02:04.150
We say that there is a negative or left skew.

02:04.230 --> 02:07.980
Once again the highest point is defined by the mode.

02:08.310 --> 02:10.950
Why is it called aleft skew again.

02:10.950 --> 02:15.310
That's right because the outliers are to the left.

02:15.330 --> 02:16.140
All right.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.520
So why is skewness important.

02:18.690 --> 02:22.860
Skewness tells us a lot about where the data is situated.

02:22.860 --> 02:29.160
As we mentioned in our previous lesson the mean median and mode should be used together to get a good

02:29.160 --> 02:35.610
understanding of the data set measures of a symmetry like skewness are the link between central tendency

02:35.610 --> 02:41.340
measures and probability theory which ultimately allows us to get a more complete understanding of the

02:41.340 --> 02:42.660
data we are working with.

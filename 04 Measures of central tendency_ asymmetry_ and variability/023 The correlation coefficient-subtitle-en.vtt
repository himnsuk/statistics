00:00.510 --> 00:07.140
Correlation adjust covariance so that the relationship between the two variables becomes easy and intuitive

00:07.140 --> 00:14.580
to interpret the formulas for the correlation coefficient or the covariance divided by the product of

00:14.580 --> 00:18.020
the standard deviations of the two variables.

00:18.030 --> 00:23.810
This is either sample or population depending on the data you are working with.

00:23.830 --> 00:28.020
We already have the standard deviations of the two data sets.

00:28.030 --> 00:34.110
Now we'll use the formula in order to find the simple correlation coefficient.

00:34.190 --> 00:41.090
Mathematically there is no way to obtain a correlation value greater than 1 or less than negative 1.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.850
Remember the coefficient of variation we talked about a couple of lessons ago.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.670
Well this concept is similar.

00:47.810 --> 00:53.070
We've been related the strange covariance value in order to get something intuitive.

00:53.090 --> 00:54.620
Let's examine it for a bit.

00:55.490 --> 00:59.180
We got a simple correlation coefficient of zero point seven.

00:59.180 --> 01:05.210
So for each foot increase in size of a house its price rises by $870.

01:05.520 --> 01:13.780
OK what about the general case a correlation of one also known as perfect positive correlation means

01:13.780 --> 01:19.270
that the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other variable.

01:19.450 --> 01:25.660
In our case this means that for every additional square foot of size we would expect an increase of

01:25.660 --> 01:28.580
let's say $1000 in the house price.

01:28.840 --> 01:35.950
For instance five additional square feet will lead to a price increase of $5000 10 additional square

01:35.950 --> 01:40.470
feet would lead to a price increase of $10000 and so on.

01:40.510 --> 01:46.570
In that case the observations in our plot will form a straight line as the correlation between size

01:46.630 --> 01:49.010
and price has to be perfect.

01:49.180 --> 01:54.850
It would mean that the size is the only variable that determines our houses price and that we can easily

01:54.850 --> 01:57.830
calculate a house price if we know its size.

01:59.010 --> 02:05.460
Before we continue we must note that the correlation between two variables x and y is the same as the

02:05.460 --> 02:08.030
correlation between y and x.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.710
The formula is completely symmetrical with respect to both variables.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.830
Therefore we must expect that an increase in price of $1000 will also mean that the size must be one

02:19.830 --> 02:20.450
square foot.

02:20.450 --> 02:29.080
Larger However logically we know that size determines price on average the bigger house you build the

02:29.080 --> 02:31.180
more expensive it will be.

02:31.180 --> 02:35.340
This relationship only goes this way once a house is built.

02:35.380 --> 02:41.170
If for some reason it becomes more expensive its size doesn't increase although there is a positive

02:41.170 --> 02:42.640
correlation.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.080
This leads us to causality.

02:45.100 --> 02:51.340
It is very important for any analyst or researcher to understand the direction of causal relationships

02:52.060 --> 02:57.380
in the house business size causes the price and not vice versa.

02:57.400 --> 03:03.220
We will explore this topic in much more detail in the regression analysis section later on.

03:03.250 --> 03:11.630
For now it is only needed that you realize that correlation does not imply causation OK a correlation

03:11.630 --> 03:16.920
of zero between two variables means that they are absolutely independent from each other.

03:16.970 --> 03:22.160
We would expect a correlation of zero between the price of coffee in Brazil and the price of houses

03:22.160 --> 03:23.500
in London right.

03:23.570 --> 03:27.580
The two variables don't have anything in common.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.460
Finally we can have negative correlation coefficient.

03:31.620 --> 03:37.650
It can be perfect negative correlation of negative one or much more likely an imperfect negative correlation

03:37.680 --> 03:41.080
of a value between negative 1 and 0.

03:41.090 --> 03:47.120
Think of the following businesses a company producing ice cream and a company selling umbrellas.

03:47.530 --> 03:53.000
Ice cream tends to be sold a lot more when the weather is very good and people buy umbrellas when it's

03:53.000 --> 03:54.080
rainy.

03:54.080 --> 03:59.030
Obviously there is a negative correlation between the two and hence when one of the companies makes

03:59.030 --> 04:01.170
more money the other won't.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.630
OK very good with this example.

04:05.660 --> 04:12.350
We conclude the section on descriptive statistics in the next lesson you will see a real life database

04:12.350 --> 04:16.380
example that applies all the knowledge you acquired in this section.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.880
You definitely don't want to miss it.

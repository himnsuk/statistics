1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,800
All right.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,050
Excellent.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,790
We've covered all Yuni variant measures.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,030
Now it is time to see measures that are used when we work with more than one variable in the next two

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,800
lessons.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,780
We'll explore measures that can help us explore the relationship between variables.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,210
Our focus will be on covariance and the linear correlation coefficient.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,220
Let's zoom out a bit and think of an example that is very easy to understand and will help us grasp

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,170
the nature of the relationship between two variables a bit better.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,780
Think about real estate which is one of the main factors that determined house prices.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,360
Their size right.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,250
Typically larger houses are more expensive as people like having extra space.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,580
The table that you can see here shows this data about several houses on the left side.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,200
We can see the size of each house and on the right we have the price at which it's been listed in a

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,840
local newspaper.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,690
We can present these data points in a scatterplot the x axes will show House's size and the y axis will

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,700
provide information about its price.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,770
We can certainly notice a pattern.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,120
There is a clear relationship between these variables.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,480
We say that two variables are correlated and the main statistic to measure this correlation is called

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:29,340
covariance unlike variance covariance may be positive equal to zero or negative.

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,590
To understand the concept better I would like to show you the formulas that allows us to calculate the

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,660
covariance between two variables.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,860
It is formulas with an S because once again there is a sample and population formula.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,020
Here they are.

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,360
Since this is obviously sample data we should use the simple covariance formula.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,520
Let's apply it in practice for the example that we saw earlier x will be the house size and y stands

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,580
for house prices.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
First we need to calculate the mean size and the mean price.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,110
Ok done.

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,310
Now let's calculate the nominator of the covariance function starting with the first house.

32
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,180
I'll multiply the difference between its size and the average house size by the difference between the

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,780
price of the same house and the average house price once we're ready.

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,180
We have to perform this calculation for all the houses that we have in the table and then some the numbers

35
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,350
we've obtained see great our sample size is five.

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,300
Now we have to divide the sum above by the sample size minus one.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,830
The result is the covariance.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,890
It gives us a sense of direction in which the two variables are moving.

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,170
If they go in the same direction the covariance will have a positive sign.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,410
While if they move in the opposite directions the covariance will have a negative sign.

41
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,370
Finally if their movements are independent the covariance between the house size and its price will

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,500
be equal to zero.

43
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,980
There is just one tiny problem with covariance though it could be a number like 5 or 50 but it can also

44
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,410
be something like 0.00 2 3 4 5 6 or even over 30 million.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,000
As in our example.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,300
Totally different values.

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,940
How could one interpret such numbers proceed to the next lecture to find out how the correlation coefficient

48
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,190
can help us with this issue.

49
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,140
Thanks for watching.

1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,090
Next on our to do list are the measures of variability.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,970
There are many ways to quantify variability.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:15,620
However we will focus on the most common ones variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,820
in the field of statistics we will typically use different formulas when working out the population

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,890
data and sample data.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,270
Let's think about this for a bit.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,250
When you have the whole population each data point is known.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,910
So you are 100 percent sure of the measures you are calculating when you take a sample of this population

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,190
and you compute a sample statistic.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,350
It is interpreted as an approximation of the population parameter.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:51,510
Moreover if you extract 10 different samples from the same population you will get 10 different measures.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,640
Statisticians have solved the problem by adjusting the algebraic formulas for many statistics to reflect

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,860
the issue.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,230
Therefore we will explore both population and sample formulas as they are both used.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,140
You must be asking yourself why there are unique formulas for the mean median and mode.

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,830
Well actually the sample mean is the average of the sample data points.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,330
While the population mean is the average of the population data points Technically there are two different

18
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,110
formulas but they are computed in the same way.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:34,670
OK now after this short clarification it's time to get on a variance variance measures the dispersion

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:42,580
of a set of data points around their mean value population variance denoted by Sigma squared is equal

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,340
to the sum of square differences between the observed values and the population mean divided by the

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,370
total number of observations.

23
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,920
Several variants on the other hand is denoted by s squared and is equal to the sum of squared differences

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,490
between observed sample values and the sample mean divided by the number of sample observations minus

25
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,460
one all right when you are getting acquainted with statistics it is hard to grasp everything right away.

26
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:20,170
Therefore let's stop for a second to examine the formula for the population and try to clarify its meaning.

27
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,750
The main part of the formula is its numerator.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,160
So that's what we want to comprehend.

29
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,030
The sum of the differences between the observations and the mean squared.

30
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,940
Hmm.

31
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,160
So the closer the number to the mean the lower the result we will obtain.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,140
Right.

33
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,590
And the further away from the mean it lies the larger the difference.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,910
Easy but why do we elevate to the second degree.

35
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,900
Squaring the differences has two main purposes.

36
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,240
First by squaring the numbers we always get non-negative computations.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,090
Without going too deep into the mathematics of it it is intuitive that dispersion cannot be negative

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,370
dispersion is about distance and distance cannot be negative.

39
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,400
If on the other hand we calculate the difference and do not elevate to the second degree we would obtain

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,610
both positive and negative values.

41
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,580
That when summed would cancel out leaving us with no information about the dispersion.

42
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,300
Second squaring amplifies the effect of large differences.

43
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,090
For example if the mean is 0 and you have an observation of 100 the squared spread is 10000 Alright

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,810
enough dry theory.

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,550
It's time for a practical example.

46
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,660
We have a population of 5 observations.

47
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,440
One two three four and five.

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,650
Let's find its variants.

49
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:53,900
We start by calculating the mean one plus two plus three plus four plus five divided by five equals

50
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,150
three.

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,920
Then we apply the formula.

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,490
We just saw one minus three squared plus two minus three squared plus three minus three squared plus

53
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,600
four minus three squared plus five minus three squared.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,200
All of these components have to be divided by five.

55
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,630
When we do the math we get two.

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:22,320
So the population variance of the data set is to but what about sample variance.

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,220
This would only be suitable if we were told that these five observations were a sample drawn from a

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,210
population.

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,410
So let's imagine that's the case the sample mean is once again three the numerator is the same but the

60
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:43,750
denominator is going to be 4 instead of 5 giving us a sample variance of 2.5 to conclude the variance

61
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,660
topic we should interpret the result.

62
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,250
Why is the simple variance bigger than the population variance in the first case.

63
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:59,340
We knew the population that is we had all the data and we calculated the variance in the second case.

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,220
We were told that 1 2 3 4 and 5 was a simple drawn from a bigger population.

65
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:15,400
Now imagine the population of this sample were 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 and 5.

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,920
Clearly the numbers are the same but there is a concentration about the two extremes of the data set

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,050
1 and 5.

68
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,500
The variance of this population is two point ninety six.

69
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,440
So our sample variance has rightfully corrected upwards.

70
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,470
In order to reflect a higher potential variability This is the reason why there are different formulas

71
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,850
for simple and population data.

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,630
This was a very important lesson.

73
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,400
So please make sure you have understood it well.

74
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,740
You can reinforce what you have learned here by doing the exercise available in the course resources

75
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,120
section.

76
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,890
Remember the subject of statistics is only understood when practiced.

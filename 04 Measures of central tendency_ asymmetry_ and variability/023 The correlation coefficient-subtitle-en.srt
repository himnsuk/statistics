1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,140
Correlation adjust covariance so that the relationship between the two variables becomes easy and intuitive

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:14,580
to interpret the formulas for the correlation coefficient or the covariance divided by the product of

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,020
the standard deviations of the two variables.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,810
This is either sample or population depending on the data you are working with.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,020
We already have the standard deviations of the two data sets.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:34,110
Now we'll use the formula in order to find the simple correlation coefficient.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,090
Mathematically there is no way to obtain a correlation value greater than 1 or less than negative 1.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,850
Remember the coefficient of variation we talked about a couple of lessons ago.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,670
Well this concept is similar.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,070
We've been related the strange covariance value in order to get something intuitive.

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,620
Let's examine it for a bit.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,180
We got a simple correlation coefficient of zero point seven.

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,210
So for each foot increase in size of a house its price rises by $870.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,780
OK what about the general case a correlation of one also known as perfect positive correlation means

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,270
that the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other variable.

16
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,660
In our case this means that for every additional square foot of size we would expect an increase of

17
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,580
let's say $1000 in the house price.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,950
For instance five additional square feet will lead to a price increase of $5000 10 additional square

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,470
feet would lead to a price increase of $10000 and so on.

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,570
In that case the observations in our plot will form a straight line as the correlation between size

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,010
and price has to be perfect.

22
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,850
It would mean that the size is the only variable that determines our houses price and that we can easily

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,830
calculate a house price if we know its size.

24
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,460
Before we continue we must note that the correlation between two variables x and y is the same as the

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,030
correlation between y and x.

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,710
The formula is completely symmetrical with respect to both variables.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,830
Therefore we must expect that an increase in price of $1000 will also mean that the size must be one

28
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,450
square foot.

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:29,080
Larger However logically we know that size determines price on average the bigger house you build the

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,180
more expensive it will be.

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,340
This relationship only goes this way once a house is built.

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,170
If for some reason it becomes more expensive its size doesn't increase although there is a positive

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,640
correlation.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,080
This leads us to causality.

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,340
It is very important for any analyst or researcher to understand the direction of causal relationships

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,380
in the house business size causes the price and not vice versa.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,220
We will explore this topic in much more detail in the regression analysis section later on.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:11,630
For now it is only needed that you realize that correlation does not imply causation OK a correlation

39
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,920
of zero between two variables means that they are absolutely independent from each other.

40
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,160
We would expect a correlation of zero between the price of coffee in Brazil and the price of houses

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,500
in London right.

42
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,580
The two variables don't have anything in common.

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,460
Finally we can have negative correlation coefficient.

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,650
It can be perfect negative correlation of negative one or much more likely an imperfect negative correlation

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,080
of a value between negative 1 and 0.

46
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,120
Think of the following businesses a company producing ice cream and a company selling umbrellas.

47
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,000
Ice cream tends to be sold a lot more when the weather is very good and people buy umbrellas when it's

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
rainy.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,030
Obviously there is a negative correlation between the two and hence when one of the companies makes

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,170
more money the other won't.

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,630
OK very good with this example.

52
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,350
We conclude the section on descriptive statistics in the next lesson you will see a real life database

53
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,380
example that applies all the knowledge you acquired in this section.

54
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,880
You definitely don't want to miss it.

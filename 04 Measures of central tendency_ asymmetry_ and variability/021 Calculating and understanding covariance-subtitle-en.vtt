00:01.080 --> 00:01.800
All right.

00:01.980 --> 00:03.050
Excellent.

00:03.060 --> 00:05.790
We've covered all Yuni variant measures.

00:05.790 --> 00:12.030
Now it is time to see measures that are used when we work with more than one variable in the next two

00:12.030 --> 00:12.800
lessons.

00:12.810 --> 00:17.780
We'll explore measures that can help us explore the relationship between variables.

00:17.850 --> 00:23.210
Our focus will be on covariance and the linear correlation coefficient.

00:23.220 --> 00:29.220
Let's zoom out a bit and think of an example that is very easy to understand and will help us grasp

00:29.220 --> 00:34.170
the nature of the relationship between two variables a bit better.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.780
Think about real estate which is one of the main factors that determined house prices.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.360
Their size right.

00:41.610 --> 00:47.250
Typically larger houses are more expensive as people like having extra space.

00:47.250 --> 00:52.580
The table that you can see here shows this data about several houses on the left side.

00:52.710 --> 00:58.200
We can see the size of each house and on the right we have the price at which it's been listed in a

00:58.200 --> 00:59.840
local newspaper.

00:59.940 --> 01:06.690
We can present these data points in a scatterplot the x axes will show House's size and the y axis will

01:06.690 --> 01:09.700
provide information about its price.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.770
We can certainly notice a pattern.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.120
There is a clear relationship between these variables.

01:15.150 --> 01:21.480
We say that two variables are correlated and the main statistic to measure this correlation is called

01:21.480 --> 01:29.340
covariance unlike variance covariance may be positive equal to zero or negative.

01:29.370 --> 01:34.590
To understand the concept better I would like to show you the formulas that allows us to calculate the

01:34.590 --> 01:37.660
covariance between two variables.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.860
It is formulas with an S because once again there is a sample and population formula.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.020
Here they are.

01:46.150 --> 01:51.360
Since this is obviously sample data we should use the simple covariance formula.

01:51.430 --> 01:57.520
Let's apply it in practice for the example that we saw earlier x will be the house size and y stands

01:57.520 --> 01:59.580
for house prices.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.840
First we need to calculate the mean size and the mean price.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.110
Ok done.

02:06.170 --> 02:12.310
Now let's calculate the nominator of the covariance function starting with the first house.

02:12.410 --> 02:17.180
I'll multiply the difference between its size and the average house size by the difference between the

02:17.180 --> 02:22.780
price of the same house and the average house price once we're ready.

02:22.780 --> 02:28.180
We have to perform this calculation for all the houses that we have in the table and then some the numbers

02:28.180 --> 02:34.350
we've obtained see great our sample size is five.

02:34.380 --> 02:39.300
Now we have to divide the sum above by the sample size minus one.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.830
The result is the covariance.

02:41.910 --> 02:46.890
It gives us a sense of direction in which the two variables are moving.

02:46.890 --> 02:51.170
If they go in the same direction the covariance will have a positive sign.

02:51.240 --> 02:56.410
While if they move in the opposite directions the covariance will have a negative sign.

02:56.430 --> 03:02.370
Finally if their movements are independent the covariance between the house size and its price will

03:02.370 --> 03:04.500
be equal to zero.

03:04.510 --> 03:11.980
There is just one tiny problem with covariance though it could be a number like 5 or 50 but it can also

03:11.980 --> 03:17.410
be something like 0.00 2 3 4 5 6 or even over 30 million.

03:17.410 --> 03:19.000
As in our example.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.300
Totally different values.

03:21.310 --> 03:27.940
How could one interpret such numbers proceed to the next lecture to find out how the correlation coefficient

03:27.940 --> 03:30.190
can help us with this issue.

03:30.190 --> 03:31.140
Thanks for watching.

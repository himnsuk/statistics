00:00.710 --> 00:05.090
Next on our to do list are the measures of variability.

00:05.150 --> 00:07.970
There are many ways to quantify variability.

00:08.030 --> 00:15.620
However we will focus on the most common ones variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation

00:16.750 --> 00:21.820
in the field of statistics we will typically use different formulas when working out the population

00:21.820 --> 00:23.890
data and sample data.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.270
Let's think about this for a bit.

00:26.470 --> 00:30.250
When you have the whole population each data point is known.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.910
So you are 100 percent sure of the measures you are calculating when you take a sample of this population

00:37.120 --> 00:39.190
and you compute a sample statistic.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.350
It is interpreted as an approximation of the population parameter.

00:44.350 --> 00:51.510
Moreover if you extract 10 different samples from the same population you will get 10 different measures.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.640
Statisticians have solved the problem by adjusting the algebraic formulas for many statistics to reflect

00:57.640 --> 00:58.860
the issue.

00:58.960 --> 01:06.230
Therefore we will explore both population and sample formulas as they are both used.

01:06.260 --> 01:12.140
You must be asking yourself why there are unique formulas for the mean median and mode.

01:12.140 --> 01:16.830
Well actually the sample mean is the average of the sample data points.

01:16.880 --> 01:23.330
While the population mean is the average of the population data points Technically there are two different

01:23.330 --> 01:26.110
formulas but they are computed in the same way.

01:27.170 --> 01:34.670
OK now after this short clarification it's time to get on a variance variance measures the dispersion

01:34.730 --> 01:42.580
of a set of data points around their mean value population variance denoted by Sigma squared is equal

01:42.580 --> 01:48.340
to the sum of square differences between the observed values and the population mean divided by the

01:48.340 --> 01:50.370
total number of observations.

01:51.260 --> 01:57.920
Several variants on the other hand is denoted by s squared and is equal to the sum of squared differences

01:57.920 --> 02:04.490
between observed sample values and the sample mean divided by the number of sample observations minus

02:04.490 --> 02:12.460
one all right when you are getting acquainted with statistics it is hard to grasp everything right away.

02:12.730 --> 02:20.170
Therefore let's stop for a second to examine the formula for the population and try to clarify its meaning.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.750
The main part of the formula is its numerator.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.160
So that's what we want to comprehend.

02:25.330 --> 02:30.030
The sum of the differences between the observations and the mean squared.

02:30.070 --> 02:30.940
Hmm.

02:31.090 --> 02:36.160
So the closer the number to the mean the lower the result we will obtain.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.140
Right.

02:37.270 --> 02:41.590
And the further away from the mean it lies the larger the difference.

02:41.680 --> 02:45.910
Easy but why do we elevate to the second degree.

02:46.210 --> 02:49.900
Squaring the differences has two main purposes.

02:49.900 --> 02:55.240
First by squaring the numbers we always get non-negative computations.

02:55.240 --> 03:01.090
Without going too deep into the mathematics of it it is intuitive that dispersion cannot be negative

03:02.020 --> 03:06.370
dispersion is about distance and distance cannot be negative.

03:06.370 --> 03:12.400
If on the other hand we calculate the difference and do not elevate to the second degree we would obtain

03:12.400 --> 03:14.610
both positive and negative values.

03:14.650 --> 03:20.580
That when summed would cancel out leaving us with no information about the dispersion.

03:20.590 --> 03:25.300
Second squaring amplifies the effect of large differences.

03:25.300 --> 03:34.090
For example if the mean is 0 and you have an observation of 100 the squared spread is 10000 Alright

03:34.340 --> 03:35.810
enough dry theory.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.550
It's time for a practical example.

03:38.570 --> 03:41.660
We have a population of 5 observations.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.440
One two three four and five.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.650
Let's find its variants.

03:46.670 --> 03:53.900
We start by calculating the mean one plus two plus three plus four plus five divided by five equals

03:53.930 --> 03:55.150
three.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.920
Then we apply the formula.

03:56.920 --> 04:04.490
We just saw one minus three squared plus two minus three squared plus three minus three squared plus

04:04.490 --> 04:08.600
four minus three squared plus five minus three squared.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.200
All of these components have to be divided by five.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.630
When we do the math we get two.

04:14.840 --> 04:22.320
So the population variance of the data set is to but what about sample variance.

04:22.330 --> 04:27.220
This would only be suitable if we were told that these five observations were a sample drawn from a

04:27.220 --> 04:28.210
population.

04:28.480 --> 04:35.410
So let's imagine that's the case the sample mean is once again three the numerator is the same but the

04:35.410 --> 04:43.750
denominator is going to be 4 instead of 5 giving us a sample variance of 2.5 to conclude the variance

04:43.750 --> 04:46.660
topic we should interpret the result.

04:46.660 --> 04:52.250
Why is the simple variance bigger than the population variance in the first case.

04:52.330 --> 04:59.340
We knew the population that is we had all the data and we calculated the variance in the second case.

04:59.470 --> 05:06.220
We were told that 1 2 3 4 and 5 was a simple drawn from a bigger population.

05:06.220 --> 05:15.400
Now imagine the population of this sample were 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 and 5.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.920
Clearly the numbers are the same but there is a concentration about the two extremes of the data set

05:21.280 --> 05:23.050
1 and 5.

05:23.210 --> 05:27.500
The variance of this population is two point ninety six.

05:27.630 --> 05:31.440
So our sample variance has rightfully corrected upwards.

05:31.440 --> 05:37.470
In order to reflect a higher potential variability This is the reason why there are different formulas

05:37.470 --> 05:39.850
for simple and population data.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.630
This was a very important lesson.

05:42.730 --> 05:45.400
So please make sure you have understood it well.

05:45.670 --> 05:50.740
You can reinforce what you have learned here by doing the exercise available in the course resources

05:50.740 --> 05:52.120
section.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.890
Remember the subject of statistics is only understood when practiced.

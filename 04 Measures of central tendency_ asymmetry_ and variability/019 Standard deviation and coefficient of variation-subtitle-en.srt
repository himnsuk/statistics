1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,300
Wild variance is a common measure of data dispersion.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,030
In most cases the figure you will obtain is pretty large and hard to compare as the unit of measurement

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,590
is squared.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:19,330
The easy fix is to calculate it square root and obtain a statistic known as standard deviation in most

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:26,500
analysis you perform standard deviation will be much more meaningful than variance as we saw in the

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,640
previous lecture.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,640
There are different measures for the population and sample variance.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,670
Consequently there is also population and sample standard deviation.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,550
The formulas are the square root of the population variance and the square root of the sample variance

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,800
respectively.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,180
I believe there is no need for an example of the calculation right.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,490
If you have a calculator in your hands you'll be able to do the job.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,630
All right.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,400
The other measure we still have to introduce is the coefficient of variation.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,500
It is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,740
Another name for the term is relative standard deviation.

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,690
This is an easy way to remember its formula.

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:16,610
It is simply the standard deviation relative to the mean as you probably guessed there is a population

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,810
and simple formula.

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:25,550
Once again so standard deviation is the most common measure of variability for a single dataset.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
But why do we need yet another measure such as the coefficient of variation.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,490
Well comparing the standard deviations of two different data sets is meaningless but comparing coefficients

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,010
of variation is not Aristotle once said.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,840
Tell me I'll forget.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
Show me I remember.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,180
Involve me all understand.

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,920
To make sure you remember here's an example of a comparison between standard deviations.

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,740
Let's take the prices of pizza at 10 different places in New York.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,050
They range from 1 to $11.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,960
Now imagine that you only have Mexican pesos and to you the prices look more like eighteen point eight

31
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,690
one pesos to two hundred six point ninety one pesos.

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:17,090
Given the exchange rate of eighteen point eight one pesos for one dollar let's combine our knowledge

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,660
so far and find the standard deviations and coefficients of variation of these two data sets.

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,230
First we have to see if this is a sample or a population.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,310
Are there only 11 restaurants in New York.

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,240
Of course not.

37
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,580
This is obviously a sample drawn from all the restaurants in the city.

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,150
Then we have to use the formulas for sample measures of variability.

39
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,070
Second we have to find the mean the mean in dollars is equal to 5.5 and the meat in pesos is one hundred

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,190
three point forty six.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,290
The third step of the process is finding the sample variance.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,070
Following the formula that we showed earlier we can obtain ten point seventy two dollars squared and

43
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,070
three thousand seven hundred ninety three point sixty nine peso squared the respective sample standard

44
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,480
deviations are three point seven dollars and sixty one point five nine pesos.

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,290
Let's make a couple of observations.

46
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,060
First variance gives results in squared units while standard deviation in original units.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,650
This is the main reasons why professionals prefer to use standard deviation as the main measure of variability.

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,280
It is directly interpretable squared dollars means nothing even in the field of statistics.

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,480
Second we got standard deviations of 3.2 seven and sixty one point five nine for the same pizza at the

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,160
same eleven restaurants in New York City.

51
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,210
Seems wrong.

52
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,120
Right.

53
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,970
Don't worry.

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,880
It is time to use our last tool.

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:59,140
The coefficient of variation dividing the standard deviations by the respective means we get the two

56
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,450
coefficients of variation.

57
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,080
The result is the same 0.60.

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,140
Notice that it is not dollars.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,750
Pesos dollars squared or pesos squared.

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,600
It is just 0.60.

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,570
This shows us the great advantage that the coefficient of variation gives us.

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,490
Now we can confidently say that the two data sets have the same variability.

63
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,910
Which is what we expected beforehand.

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,790
Let's recap what we have learned so far.

65
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,180
There are three main measures of variability variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation.

66
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,870
You should feel confident using all of them as we're getting closer to more complex statistical topics.

67
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,120
And remember Aristotle's advice involve me I'll understand.

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,060
So please don't forget to get involved with the exercises.

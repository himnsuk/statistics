00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,000
This lesson we'll introduce you to the three measures of central tendency.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Don't be scared by the terminology we are talking about mean median and mode even if you are familiar

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,530
with these terms.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,570
Please stick around as we will explore their upsides and shortfalls.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,620
Ready let's go.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,140
The first measure we will study is the mean.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,040
Also known as the simple average it is denoted by the Greek letter mue for a population an X bar for

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,330
a sample.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,660
These notions will come in handy in the next section we can find the mean of a dataset by adding up

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,860
all of its components and then dividing them by the number of components contained in the data set.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,160
The mean is the most common measure of central tendency but it has a huge downside.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,900
It is easily affected by outliers.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Let's compare these two data sets.

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,380
These are the prices of pizza at 11 different locations in New York City and 10 different locations

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
in L.A..

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,610
Let's calculate the means of the two data sets using the formula for the mean in NYC.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,950
We get $11 whereas for L.A. just 5.5 on average pizza.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,740
New York can't be twice as expensive as in L.A. right.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,880
Correct.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,350
The problem is that in our sample we have included one posh place in New York where they charge $66

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,140
for a pizza.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,540
And this doubled to mean what we should take away from this example is that the mean is not enough to

23
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,970
make definite conclusions.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,650
So how can we protect ourselves from this issue.

25
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:44,800
You guessed it we can calculate the second measure the median the median is basically the middle number

26
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,710
in an ordered dataset.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,410
Let's see how it works for our example.

28
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,170
In order to calculate the median we have to order our dataset in ascending order the median of the dataset

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:04,030
is the number at position end plus 1 divided by two in the ordered list where n is the number of observations

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:12,370
therefore the median for NYC is at the 6 position or six dollars much closer to the observed prices

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,280
than the mean of dollars right.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,560
What about L.A..

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,560
We have just 10 observations in L.A. According to our formula the median is at position 5.5.

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
In cases like this the median is the simple average of the numbers.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,150
Positions 5 and 6.

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,350
Therefore the median of L.A. prices is five point five dollars.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,070
OK.

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,410
We have seen that the median is not affected by extreme prices which is good when we have posh New York

39
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,850
restaurants in a street pizza sample but we still don't get the full picture or the majority of restaurants

40
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,370
low cost or average.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,640
We must introduce another measure the mode.

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,000
The mode is the value that occurs most often.

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,240
It can be used for numerical and categorical data but we will stick to our numerical example.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,570
After counting the frequencies of each value we find that the mode of New York pizza prices is $3.

45
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,370
Now that's interesting.

46
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,210
The most common price of pizza in NYC is just $3 but the mean and median led us to believe it was much

47
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:29,570
more expensive OK let's do the same and find the mode of L.A. pizza prices from each price appears only

48
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,370
once.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,010
How do we find the mode then.

50
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,780
Well we say that there is no mode but can I say that there are 10 modes you may ask.

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,300
Sure you can but it will be meaningless with 10 observations and an experienced statistician would never

52
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,480
do that.

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,190
In general you often have multiple modes usually two or three modes are tolerable.

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,560
But more than that would defeat the purpose of finding a mode.

55
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,840
There is one less question that we haven't answered which measure is best the NYC and L.A. example shows

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,820
us that measures of central tendency should be used together rather than independently.

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,820
Therefore there is no best.

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,590
But using only one is definitely the worst.

59
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,240
All right.

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,080
Now you know about the mean median and mode.

61
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,670
In our next video we will use that knowledge to talk about skewness.

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,490
Stay tuned and thanks for watching.

00:00.880 --> 00:04.300
Wild variance is a common measure of data dispersion.

00:04.360 --> 00:10.030
In most cases the figure you will obtain is pretty large and hard to compare as the unit of measurement

00:10.030 --> 00:11.590
is squared.

00:11.590 --> 00:19.330
The easy fix is to calculate it square root and obtain a statistic known as standard deviation in most

00:19.330 --> 00:26.500
analysis you perform standard deviation will be much more meaningful than variance as we saw in the

00:26.500 --> 00:27.640
previous lecture.

00:27.670 --> 00:31.640
There are different measures for the population and sample variance.

00:31.660 --> 00:36.670
Consequently there is also population and sample standard deviation.

00:36.820 --> 00:42.550
The formulas are the square root of the population variance and the square root of the sample variance

00:42.550 --> 00:43.800
respectively.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.180
I believe there is no need for an example of the calculation right.

00:48.250 --> 00:51.490
If you have a calculator in your hands you'll be able to do the job.

00:52.730 --> 00:53.630
All right.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.400
The other measure we still have to introduce is the coefficient of variation.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.500
It is equal to the standard deviation divided by the mean.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.740
Another name for the term is relative standard deviation.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.690
This is an easy way to remember its formula.

01:09.690 --> 01:16.610
It is simply the standard deviation relative to the mean as you probably guessed there is a population

01:16.700 --> 01:17.810
and simple formula.

01:17.810 --> 01:25.550
Once again so standard deviation is the most common measure of variability for a single dataset.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.320
But why do we need yet another measure such as the coefficient of variation.

01:30.640 --> 01:36.490
Well comparing the standard deviations of two different data sets is meaningless but comparing coefficients

01:36.490 --> 01:41.010
of variation is not Aristotle once said.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.840
Tell me I'll forget.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.820
Show me I remember.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.180
Involve me all understand.

01:47.460 --> 01:52.920
To make sure you remember here's an example of a comparison between standard deviations.

01:53.370 --> 01:57.740
Let's take the prices of pizza at 10 different places in New York.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.050
They range from 1 to $11.

02:01.050 --> 02:06.960
Now imagine that you only have Mexican pesos and to you the prices look more like eighteen point eight

02:06.970 --> 02:10.690
one pesos to two hundred six point ninety one pesos.

02:10.710 --> 02:17.090
Given the exchange rate of eighteen point eight one pesos for one dollar let's combine our knowledge

02:17.090 --> 02:23.660
so far and find the standard deviations and coefficients of variation of these two data sets.

02:23.720 --> 02:28.230
First we have to see if this is a sample or a population.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.310
Are there only 11 restaurants in New York.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.240
Of course not.

02:32.390 --> 02:36.580
This is obviously a sample drawn from all the restaurants in the city.

02:36.650 --> 02:41.150
Then we have to use the formulas for sample measures of variability.

02:41.150 --> 02:49.070
Second we have to find the mean the mean in dollars is equal to 5.5 and the meat in pesos is one hundred

02:49.070 --> 02:51.190
three point forty six.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.290
The third step of the process is finding the sample variance.

02:55.460 --> 03:01.070
Following the formula that we showed earlier we can obtain ten point seventy two dollars squared and

03:01.070 --> 03:07.070
three thousand seven hundred ninety three point sixty nine peso squared the respective sample standard

03:07.070 --> 03:12.480
deviations are three point seven dollars and sixty one point five nine pesos.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.290
Let's make a couple of observations.

03:16.420 --> 03:23.060
First variance gives results in squared units while standard deviation in original units.

03:23.080 --> 03:29.650
This is the main reasons why professionals prefer to use standard deviation as the main measure of variability.

03:29.650 --> 03:36.280
It is directly interpretable squared dollars means nothing even in the field of statistics.

03:36.280 --> 03:43.480
Second we got standard deviations of 3.2 seven and sixty one point five nine for the same pizza at the

03:43.480 --> 03:46.160
same eleven restaurants in New York City.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.210
Seems wrong.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.120
Right.

03:48.130 --> 03:48.970
Don't worry.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.880
It is time to use our last tool.

03:51.880 --> 03:59.140
The coefficient of variation dividing the standard deviations by the respective means we get the two

03:59.140 --> 04:01.450
coefficients of variation.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.080
The result is the same 0.60.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.140
Notice that it is not dollars.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.750
Pesos dollars squared or pesos squared.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.600
It is just 0.60.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.570
This shows us the great advantage that the coefficient of variation gives us.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.490
Now we can confidently say that the two data sets have the same variability.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.910
Which is what we expected beforehand.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.790
Let's recap what we have learned so far.

04:29.860 --> 04:37.180
There are three main measures of variability variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation.

04:37.180 --> 04:43.870
You should feel confident using all of them as we're getting closer to more complex statistical topics.

04:43.870 --> 04:49.120
And remember Aristotle's advice involve me I'll understand.

04:49.120 --> 04:53.060
So please don't forget to get involved with the exercises.

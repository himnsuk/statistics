00:00.600 --> 00:06.910
In our last video we learned about confidence intervals for two means based on dependent samples.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.320
In this video we will explore independent samples as we said earlier.

00:12.420 --> 00:18.990
There are three sub cases known population variances unknown population variances but assumed to be

00:18.990 --> 00:24.310
equal an unknown population variances that are assumed to be different.

00:24.320 --> 00:29.910
Here we will focus on independent samples with known population variances.

00:29.920 --> 00:36.460
All right let's jump right into the example that would allow us to understand the concept a bit better.

00:36.730 --> 00:40.990
We would like to get the test grades of two departments in a UK university.

00:41.140 --> 00:45.190
University grades in the UK expressed in percentages.

00:45.520 --> 00:51.220
Our samples are taken from two departments engineering and management.

00:51.220 --> 00:54.870
The table you see here summarizes the data.

00:54.980 --> 01:00.900
We have a sample of 100 engineering students and the average grade is 58 percent.

01:01.010 --> 01:06.740
From past years we know that the population standard deviation is 10 percentage points.

01:06.740 --> 01:09.260
Thus the variance is known.

01:09.260 --> 01:14.960
We also have a sample of 70 students from the management department and we've got a sample mean of 65

01:14.960 --> 01:16.280
percent.

01:16.290 --> 01:23.550
Again from past data we know that the population standard deviation is 5 percent OK.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.790
But before we get on with calculations.

01:25.870 --> 01:28.550
Let's point out three important considerations.

01:29.310 --> 01:33.380
First the populations are normally distributed.

01:33.450 --> 01:40.900
Second the population variances are known and third the sample sizes are different.

01:40.920 --> 01:47.140
Different sample sizes are a common occurrence in the real world in our previous lesson.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.870
When we had dependent samples we were testing the same people over time so it made sense that the sample

01:52.870 --> 01:55.020
sizes were equally big.

01:55.030 --> 01:59.400
This time however the observations are completely different.

01:59.410 --> 02:04.570
They are students from different departments with different teachers obtaining different grades when

02:04.570 --> 02:06.790
taking different exams.

02:06.790 --> 02:11.890
The great of a person from engineering doesn't in any way affect the grade of a person studying management

02:12.060 --> 02:12.750
right.

02:13.180 --> 02:16.850
The two samples are truly independent.

02:16.910 --> 02:17.980
All right.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.760
What are we testing.

02:19.820 --> 02:25.330
We want to find a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the grades of the students

02:25.340 --> 02:30.190
from engineering and management as with every confidence interval.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.900
We must identify the test to take samples.

02:33.900 --> 02:40.830
Our big population variances are known and populations are assumed to follow the normal distribution.

02:40.830 --> 02:46.320
All this information points us to the Z statistic instead of the T.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.300
The last ingredient is the variance.

02:49.300 --> 02:54.520
We haven't been through enough mathematics in this course to derive the formula so we will simply state

02:54.520 --> 02:55.250
it.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.520
The variance of the difference between the two means is equal to the variance of the grades received

03:00.550 --> 03:07.060
by engineering students divided by the sample size of engineering students plus the variance of grades

03:07.090 --> 03:14.120
obtained by management students divided by the sample size of management students the underlying logic

03:14.180 --> 03:16.790
is that dispersion is additive.

03:16.790 --> 03:21.470
More variables means higher or equal variability.

03:21.470 --> 03:29.600
OK so what is the confidence interval formula this time well it is given by the expression below.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.810
X bar minus Y Bar is the difference point estimator Z is the statistic.

03:35.830 --> 03:38.680
And this is the variance of the difference.

03:38.680 --> 03:46.570
We plug in the numbers and get a confidence interval between minus nine point to 8 and minus 4.7 to.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.310
All right what's the interpretation.

03:49.580 --> 03:55.370
We are 95 percent confident that the true mean difference between engineering and management grades

03:55.400 --> 03:58.000
falls into this interval.

03:58.010 --> 04:01.820
Note that this time the whole interval is negative.

04:01.820 --> 04:08.840
This is because we were calculating engineering grade minus management grade as the engineers were consistently

04:08.840 --> 04:10.040
getting lower grades.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.050
The difference is negative.

04:12.110 --> 04:17.090
Had we calculated the difference as management minus engineering we would have obtained a confidence

04:17.090 --> 04:23.620
interval between 4.7 to and nine point to eight completely symmetrical around zero.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.320
All right great.

04:26.320 --> 04:31.930
Remember to do all the exercises available in the course materials as the topics are getting tougher

04:31.930 --> 04:33.150
and tougher.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.320
See you next time.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.530
And thanks for watching.

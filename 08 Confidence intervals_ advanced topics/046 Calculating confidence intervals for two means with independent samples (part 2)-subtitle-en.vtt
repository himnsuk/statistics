00:00.480 --> 00:05.660
High again in the last few lessons we've been focusing on confidence intervals.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.290
We'll do that here too.

00:07.590 --> 00:13.790
This lesson is about independent samples with variances unknown but assumed to be equal.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.630
All right.

00:14.630 --> 00:20.300
Think about this example you are trying to calculate the difference of the price of apples in New York

00:20.360 --> 00:27.140
and L.A. you go to 10 grocery shops in New York and your friend Paul who lives in L.A. visits a grocery

00:27.140 --> 00:29.490
shops in order to help you with the research.

00:30.230 --> 00:35.630
Once you've organized the data in a table you start reflecting on how you can create a confidence interval

00:35.690 --> 00:38.880
that shows the difference between the price of apples or New York.

00:38.900 --> 00:45.620
And that way you don't know what the population variance of apples or New York or L.A. is but you assume

00:45.620 --> 00:53.510
it should be the same for NY and L.A. So you calculate the mean price in NY and L.A. and obtained $3

00:53.510 --> 00:58.230
and 94 cents and $3 and 25 cents respectively.

00:58.250 --> 01:05.020
Moreover their sample standard deviations are 18 cents and 27 cents.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.540
What should we do now.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.280
Well we assume that the population variances are equal.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.130
So we have to estimate them.

01:12.580 --> 01:18.070
The unbiased estimate or in this case is called the pooled sample variance and we could use the following

01:18.070 --> 01:25.620
formula to calculate it as you can see it is based solely on the sample sizes and the sample standard

01:25.620 --> 01:29.010
deviations of the two datasets.

01:29.210 --> 01:36.470
We quickly plug in the numbers and get a pooled sample variance of 0.05 and a pooled standard deviation

01:36.530 --> 01:38.900
of 22 cents.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.920
How about the statistic needed to form a confidence interval Well we have an unknown variance.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.960
So you guessed it it's the t statistic.

01:51.090 --> 01:53.760
Here's the formula for the confidence interval.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.310
Let's compare it to the formula for independent samples with known variance.

01:59.360 --> 02:05.750
We have the same difference of sample means for the variances instead of population variances.

02:05.750 --> 02:13.670
We have the pooled sample variants and then instead of the Z statistic we have the statistic although

02:13.670 --> 02:15.140
the formulas are different.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.090
They are very consistent right.

02:18.110 --> 02:23.160
You must be wondering about the statistic though it is a bit stranger this time.

02:23.210 --> 02:29.930
So let's quickly try to clarify it the degrees of freedom are equal to the total sample size minus the

02:29.930 --> 02:31.350
number of variables.

02:32.220 --> 02:39.420
So far we have seen t's with n minus 1 degrees of freedom because we had a sample size of N and only

02:39.420 --> 02:41.070
one variable.

02:41.260 --> 02:49.180
This time we have two sample sizes one of ten and one of eight observations and two variables.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.570
Apple prices in New York and aval prices in L.A..

02:52.840 --> 02:57.150
Therefore we have 16 degrees of freedom.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.190
All right.

02:58.190 --> 03:04.400
Checking the statistic from the table for a 95 percent confidence interval with 16 degrees of freedom

03:04.670 --> 03:06.760
we get 2.1 too.

03:07.040 --> 03:14.900
Let's plug everything in and get our answer the 95 percent confidence interval is between 0.4 7 and

03:14.900 --> 03:17.040
0.9 to.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.320
What's the interpretation.

03:19.320 --> 03:26.070
Well we are 95 percent confident that the actual difference between the two populations price of apples

03:26.070 --> 03:34.290
in New York and in L.A. is somewhere between 0.4 7 and 0.9 to therefore it is clear that apples in New

03:34.290 --> 03:37.770
York are much more expensive than in Olay.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.750
Good job and thanks for watching.

00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,910
In our last video we learned about confidence intervals for two means based on dependent samples.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,320
In this video we will explore independent samples as we said earlier.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,990
There are three sub cases known population variances unknown population variances but assumed to be

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,310
equal an unknown population variances that are assumed to be different.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,910
Here we will focus on independent samples with known population variances.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,460
All right let's jump right into the example that would allow us to understand the concept a bit better.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,990
We would like to get the test grades of two departments in a UK university.

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,190
University grades in the UK expressed in percentages.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,220
Our samples are taken from two departments engineering and management.

10
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,870
The table you see here summarizes the data.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,900
We have a sample of 100 engineering students and the average grade is 58 percent.

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,740
From past years we know that the population standard deviation is 10 percentage points.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,260
Thus the variance is known.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,960
We also have a sample of 70 students from the management department and we've got a sample mean of 65

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
percent.

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,550
Again from past data we know that the population standard deviation is 5 percent OK.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,790
But before we get on with calculations.

18
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,550
Let's point out three important considerations.

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,380
First the populations are normally distributed.

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,900
Second the population variances are known and third the sample sizes are different.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,140
Different sample sizes are a common occurrence in the real world in our previous lesson.

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,870
When we had dependent samples we were testing the same people over time so it made sense that the sample

23
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,020
sizes were equally big.

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,400
This time however the observations are completely different.

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,570
They are students from different departments with different teachers obtaining different grades when

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,790
taking different exams.

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,890
The great of a person from engineering doesn't in any way affect the grade of a person studying management

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,750
right.

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,850
The two samples are truly independent.

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,980
All right.

31
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,760
What are we testing.

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,330
We want to find a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the grades of the students

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,190
from engineering and management as with every confidence interval.

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,900
We must identify the test to take samples.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,830
Our big population variances are known and populations are assumed to follow the normal distribution.

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,320
All this information points us to the Z statistic instead of the T.

37
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,300
The last ingredient is the variance.

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,520
We haven't been through enough mathematics in this course to derive the formula so we will simply state

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,250
it.

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,520
The variance of the difference between the two means is equal to the variance of the grades received

41
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,060
by engineering students divided by the sample size of engineering students plus the variance of grades

42
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,120
obtained by management students divided by the sample size of management students the underlying logic

43
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,790
is that dispersion is additive.

44
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,470
More variables means higher or equal variability.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,600
OK so what is the confidence interval formula this time well it is given by the expression below.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,810
X bar minus Y Bar is the difference point estimator Z is the statistic.

47
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,680
And this is the variance of the difference.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,570
We plug in the numbers and get a confidence interval between minus nine point to 8 and minus 4.7 to.

49
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,310
All right what's the interpretation.

50
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,370
We are 95 percent confident that the true mean difference between engineering and management grades

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
falls into this interval.

52
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,820
Note that this time the whole interval is negative.

53
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,840
This is because we were calculating engineering grade minus management grade as the engineers were consistently

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,040
getting lower grades.

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,050
The difference is negative.

56
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,090
Had we calculated the difference as management minus engineering we would have obtained a confidence

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,620
interval between 4.7 to and nine point to eight completely symmetrical around zero.

58
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,320
All right great.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,930
Remember to do all the exercises available in the course materials as the topics are getting tougher

60
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,150
and tougher.

61
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,320
See you next time.

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,530
And thanks for watching.

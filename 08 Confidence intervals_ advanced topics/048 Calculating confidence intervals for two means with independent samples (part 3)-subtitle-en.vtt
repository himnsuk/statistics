Hi and welcome back.

00:03.070 --> 00:06.660
This is the last lesson about confidence intervals.

00:06.690 --> 00:11.740
We are not going to get too deep into it as it is just about knowing the formula.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.910
Sometimes we want to find the confidence interval for two simple means.

00:15.910 --> 00:22.060
When the samples are independent with unknown variances and when the variances are assumed to be different

00:22.960 --> 00:25.920
you can think about comparing apples and oranges.

00:25.930 --> 00:29.470
You've heard the expression right well in statistics.

00:29.470 --> 00:34.680
If you actually want to compare apples and oranges This is the right way to do it.

00:34.690 --> 00:38.020
Here's the confidence interval formula.

00:38.050 --> 00:42.730
Once again we have the differences of the means of the two samples.

00:42.730 --> 00:46.860
The variances are the simple variances of each of the two variables.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.040
And here are the respective sample sizes.

00:50.050 --> 00:55.260
The tough thing about this is to estimate the degrees of freedom well.

00:55.300 --> 01:00.070
Statisticians have come up with a formula that allows us to do just that.

01:00.100 --> 01:05.650
You have all the information but it is highly unlikely that you will remember the formula.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.530
All right.

01:06.680 --> 01:11.110
We won't give an example of this case as it will add any value to this course.

01:11.270 --> 01:16.330
In this video we just wanted to show you the right way to compare apples and oranges.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.610
Next time we will get to the core of statistics.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.850
Hypothesis Testing.

01:21.950 --> 01:22.880
Don't miss out.

01:22.970 --> 01:24.140
And thanks for watching.

Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,660
This is the last lesson about confidence intervals.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,740
We are not going to get too deep into it as it is just about knowing the formula.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,910
Sometimes we want to find the confidence interval for two simple means.

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,060
When the samples are independent with unknown variances and when the variances are assumed to be different

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,920
you can think about comparing apples and oranges.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,470
You've heard the expression right well in statistics.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,680
If you actually want to compare apples and oranges This is the right way to do it.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,020
Here's the confidence interval formula.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,730
Once again we have the differences of the means of the two samples.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,860
The variances are the simple variances of each of the two variables.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,040
And here are the respective sample sizes.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,260
The tough thing about this is to estimate the degrees of freedom well.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,070
Statisticians have come up with a formula that allows us to do just that.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,650
You have all the information but it is highly unlikely that you will remember the formula.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,530
All right.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,110
We won't give an example of this case as it will add any value to this course.

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,330
In this video we just wanted to show you the right way to compare apples and oranges.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,610
Next time we will get to the core of statistics.

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,850
Hypothesis Testing.

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,880
Don't miss out.

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,140
And thanks for watching.

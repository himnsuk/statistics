00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,750
So far we have talked about confidence intervals with population variances that are either known or

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,410
unknown.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,340
However we were considering only one population in the next couple of lessons.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,960
We will explore confidence intervals looking into two populations.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,180
These cases are more important as they have a wide range of real world applications.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,750
A few important distinctions need to be made.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,990
Before we dive into this topic in some cases the samples that we have taken from the two populations

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,410
will be dependent on each other and in others they will be independent dependent.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,370
Samples are easier you will experience this firsthand when we have independent samples however we can

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,490
further distinguish three cases when the population variance is known when the population variance is

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,500
unknown but assumed to be equal.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,430
And when it is unknown and assumed to be different sounds a bit overwhelming.

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,300
But don't worry in statistics many concepts are similar to each other and you will quickly see that

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,420
you have already acquired the intuition that allows you to understand these concepts pretty fast.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,510
All right let's get onto the first case namely dependent samples.

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,100
This statistical test is often used when developing medicine.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,500
Let's say you have developed a pill that increases the concentration of magnesium in the blood.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,600
It is very promising but there is no data to support your claim.

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,700
After testing the drug in the laboratory it is time to see its actual effect on people.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,310
What you would typically do is take a sample of 10 people and test their magnesium levels before and

21
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,010
after taking the pill.

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,140
The two dependent samples are the magnesium levels before and the magnesium levels after it is clear

23
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,450
that it is the same people we are testing.

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,730
Thus the samples are dependent an important note is that the populations are normally distributed actually

25
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,490
when dealing with biology.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,360
Normality is so often observed that we immediately assume that such variables are normally distributed

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,350
OK back to the example.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,460
Whenever you take a blood test the magnesium levels are stated in milligrams per deciliter and a healthy

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:29,100
person would usually have somewhere between 1.7 and 2.2 milligrams of magnesium per deciliter.

30
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,900
Here is a table that contains the sample of 10 people and their levels of magnesium before and after

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,210
taking the pill for some time.

32
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:43,630
We've also added a cell that calculates the difference in levels before and after taking the pill instead

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,250
of dealing with two variables.

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,780
We now have only one in this way.

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,810
The data looks as a single population doesn't it.

36
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,320
Let's calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the differences the mean is zero point three

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,860
three.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,090
And the standard deviation is zero point four or five.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,140
Moreover we know that the sample size is 10.

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,400
The formula that would allow us to calculate a confidence interval is the following.

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,640
The population is normally distributed but the sample we have contains only 10 observations.

42
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,720
Therefore the distribution will have to work with students T and the appropriate statistic is t.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,550
You can clearly see that it is the same as the one for a single population with an unknown variance.

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,020
Let's choose a level of confidence and plug in the numbers as we have said many times.

45
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,580
95 percent confidence is one of the most common levels.

46
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,280
And so we will use it here as well.

47
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,730
The t statistic with nine degrees of freedom for a 95 percent confidence interval is 2.2 6.

48
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,750
Now we have everything we need and we can calculate the confidence interval.

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,980
It lies in the range between 0.01 and 0.6 5.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,970
How do we interpret this result.

51
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,200
Well 95 percent of the cases the true mean will fall in this interval.

52
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,840
Moreover the whole interval is positive.

53
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,310
This shows that the true meaning of the difference is definitely positive.

54
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,740
Therefore with 95 percent certainty we can say that the levels of magnesium in the test subjects blood

55
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,710
is higher.

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,530
The purpose of this test was to determine whether the drug is effective based on our small sample.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,970
It most likely is.

58
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,050
All right.

59
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,780
This shows you some of the practical applications of inference.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,530
Stay tuned for our next lesson in which we will explore confidence intervals on independence Serviles.

00:00.780 --> 00:06.750
So far we have talked about confidence intervals with population variances that are either known or

00:06.810 --> 00:08.410
unknown.

00:08.430 --> 00:14.340
However we were considering only one population in the next couple of lessons.

00:14.370 --> 00:18.960
We will explore confidence intervals looking into two populations.

00:18.960 --> 00:24.180
These cases are more important as they have a wide range of real world applications.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.750
A few important distinctions need to be made.

00:27.750 --> 00:34.990
Before we dive into this topic in some cases the samples that we have taken from the two populations

00:35.080 --> 00:41.410
will be dependent on each other and in others they will be independent dependent.

00:41.410 --> 00:48.370
Samples are easier you will experience this firsthand when we have independent samples however we can

00:48.370 --> 00:54.490
further distinguish three cases when the population variance is known when the population variance is

00:54.550 --> 00:56.500
unknown but assumed to be equal.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.430
And when it is unknown and assumed to be different sounds a bit overwhelming.

01:01.450 --> 01:07.300
But don't worry in statistics many concepts are similar to each other and you will quickly see that

01:07.300 --> 01:13.420
you have already acquired the intuition that allows you to understand these concepts pretty fast.

01:13.420 --> 01:18.510
All right let's get onto the first case namely dependent samples.

01:18.530 --> 01:23.100
This statistical test is often used when developing medicine.

01:23.160 --> 01:28.500
Let's say you have developed a pill that increases the concentration of magnesium in the blood.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.600
It is very promising but there is no data to support your claim.

01:32.850 --> 01:38.700
After testing the drug in the laboratory it is time to see its actual effect on people.

01:38.790 --> 01:44.310
What you would typically do is take a sample of 10 people and test their magnesium levels before and

01:44.310 --> 01:46.010
after taking the pill.

01:46.260 --> 01:53.140
The two dependent samples are the magnesium levels before and the magnesium levels after it is clear

01:53.140 --> 01:55.450
that it is the same people we are testing.

01:55.510 --> 02:03.730
Thus the samples are dependent an important note is that the populations are normally distributed actually

02:03.940 --> 02:05.490
when dealing with biology.

02:05.500 --> 02:11.360
Normality is so often observed that we immediately assume that such variables are normally distributed

02:13.140 --> 02:15.350
OK back to the example.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.460
Whenever you take a blood test the magnesium levels are stated in milligrams per deciliter and a healthy

02:21.460 --> 02:29.100
person would usually have somewhere between 1.7 and 2.2 milligrams of magnesium per deciliter.

02:29.140 --> 02:34.900
Here is a table that contains the sample of 10 people and their levels of magnesium before and after

02:34.900 --> 02:37.210
taking the pill for some time.

02:37.270 --> 02:43.630
We've also added a cell that calculates the difference in levels before and after taking the pill instead

02:43.630 --> 02:45.250
of dealing with two variables.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.780
We now have only one in this way.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.810
The data looks as a single population doesn't it.

02:53.150 --> 02:59.320
Let's calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the differences the mean is zero point three

02:59.320 --> 02:59.860
three.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.090
And the standard deviation is zero point four or five.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.140
Moreover we know that the sample size is 10.

03:08.300 --> 03:13.400
The formula that would allow us to calculate a confidence interval is the following.

03:13.480 --> 03:19.640
The population is normally distributed but the sample we have contains only 10 observations.

03:19.930 --> 03:26.720
Therefore the distribution will have to work with students T and the appropriate statistic is t.

03:26.740 --> 03:32.550
You can clearly see that it is the same as the one for a single population with an unknown variance.

03:33.360 --> 03:39.020
Let's choose a level of confidence and plug in the numbers as we have said many times.

03:39.190 --> 03:42.580
95 percent confidence is one of the most common levels.

03:42.630 --> 03:45.280
And so we will use it here as well.

03:45.330 --> 03:52.730
The t statistic with nine degrees of freedom for a 95 percent confidence interval is 2.2 6.

03:52.740 --> 03:57.750
Now we have everything we need and we can calculate the confidence interval.

03:57.750 --> 04:02.980
It lies in the range between 0.01 and 0.6 5.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.970
How do we interpret this result.

04:05.310 --> 04:11.200
Well 95 percent of the cases the true mean will fall in this interval.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.840
Moreover the whole interval is positive.

04:14.850 --> 04:19.310
This shows that the true meaning of the difference is definitely positive.

04:19.350 --> 04:25.740
Therefore with 95 percent certainty we can say that the levels of magnesium in the test subjects blood

04:25.770 --> 04:27.710
is higher.

04:27.750 --> 04:33.530
The purpose of this test was to determine whether the drug is effective based on our small sample.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.970
It most likely is.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.050
All right.

04:37.050 --> 04:40.780
This shows you some of the practical applications of inference.

04:40.800 --> 04:46.530
Stay tuned for our next lesson in which we will explore confidence intervals on independence Serviles.

00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,320
Now that we've seen the different types of data and levels of measurement we can have we are ready to

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,600
explore different graphs and tables which will allow us to visually represent the data we are working

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,130
with visualizing data is the most intuitive way to interpret it.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,520
So it will be great if we learn how to do that.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,430
As you may recall there are two types of variables categorical and numerical.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,440
In this video we will focus on categorical variables.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,500
The most common ways to visualize them are frequency distribution tables bar charts pie charts and Pareto

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,030
diagrams.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,440
First let's see what a frequency distribution table looks like.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,210
It has two columns.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,800
The category itself and the corresponding frequency.

12
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,120
Imagine you own a car shop and you sell only German cars.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,180
The table below shows the categories of cars.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:03,620
Audi BMW and Mercedes and their frequency or in plain English the number of units sold by organizing

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,150
your data.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,640
This way you can compare the different brands and see that Audi has been sold the most.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,370
No preference is on my side.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,350
However tables aren't much fun are they using the same table.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,530
We can construct a bar chart.

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,340
The vertical axis shows the number of units sold while each bar represents a different category.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:33,040
Indicated on the horizontal axes in this way it is much much clear that ADI is the best selling brand

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,320
OK let's represent the same data with a pie chart in order to build one.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,670
We need to calculate the percentage of the total of each brand in statistics.

24
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,590
This is known as relative frequency.

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,190
Naturally all relative frequencies add up to 100 percent.

26
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,120
Pie charts are especially useful when we not only want to compare items among each other but also to

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,750
see their share of the total this example could be easily transformed into a business example of market

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,550
share.

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,560
Market share is so predominantly represented by pie charts that if you search for market share in google

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,840
images you would get only pie charts.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,880
Imagine that the data in our table is representing the sales of Audi BMW and Mercedes in a single German

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,750
city St. bàn.

33
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,290
The chart will show us the market share that each of these brands has Leslie.

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,530
We have the Pareto diagram.

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,860
In fact a Pareto diagram is nothing more than a special type of bar chart where categories are shown

36
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,240
in descending orders of frequency by frequency.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,420
Statisticians mean the number of occurrences of each item.

38
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,290
As we said earlier in our example that's exactly the number of units sold.

39
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,880
Let's go back to our frequency distribution table and ordered the brands by frequency.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Now we can create the bar chart based on our reorder table and voila we almost have a Pareto diagram.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,720
There is one last touch to make it one a curve on the same graph showing the cumulative frequency cumulative

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,190
frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies.

43
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,870
It starts at the frequency of the first brand.

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,840
Then we add the second the third and so on until it finishes at 100 percent.

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,240
This polygon a line is measured by a different vertical axes on the right of the graph.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,440
At the end of its vertices it shows the sum total of the categories to its left see how the Pareto diagrams

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,980
combines the strong sides of the bar and the pie chart.

48
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,990
It is easy to compare the data both between categories and as a part of the total.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,140
Furthermore if this was a market share graph you could easily see the market share of the top two or

50
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,220
top five companies.

51
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,760
These are the main ways in which we visually represent categorical data.

52
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:05,360
In our next lecture we will get acquainted with the most useful graphs and tables for numerical data.

53
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,230
Thanks for watching.

00:00.810 --> 00:07.560
So far we covered graphs that represent only one variable but how do we represent relationships between

00:07.590 --> 00:09.080
two variables.

00:09.390 --> 00:13.840
In this video we'll explore across tables and scatter plots.

00:13.890 --> 00:19.170
Once again we have a division between categorical and numerical variables.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.390
Let's start with categorical variables.

00:22.440 --> 00:28.860
The most common way to represent them is using cross tables or as some statisticians call them contingency

00:28.860 --> 00:29.630
tables.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.680
Imagine you are an investment manager and you manage stocks bonds and real estate investments for three

00:36.680 --> 00:38.360
different investors.

00:38.360 --> 00:43.780
Each of them has a different idea of risk and hence their money is allocated in a different way.

00:43.790 --> 00:50.810
Among the three asset classes across table representing all the data looks in the following way you

00:50.810 --> 00:55.850
can clearly see the rows showing the different type of investment that's been made and the columns with

00:55.850 --> 00:57.810
each investor's allocation.

00:57.920 --> 01:03.830
It is good practice to calculate the totals of each row and column as it is often useful in further

01:03.830 --> 01:05.050
analysis.

01:05.060 --> 01:11.360
Notice that the subtotals of the rows give us total investment in stocks bonds and real estate.

01:11.510 --> 01:18.520
On the other hand the subtotals of the columns gives us the holdings of each investor once we have created

01:18.520 --> 01:24.740
a cross table we can proceed to visualizing the data onto a plane a very useful chart.

01:24.760 --> 01:30.320
In such cases is a variation of the bar chart called the side by side bar chart.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.400
It represents the holdings of each investor in the different types of assets.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.540
Stocks are in green.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.860
Bonds are in red.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.230
And real estate is in blue.

01:41.260 --> 01:47.020
The name of this type of chart comes from the fact that for each investor the categories of assets are

01:47.020 --> 01:48.940
represented side by side.

01:49.210 --> 01:55.900
In this way we can easily compare asset holdings for a specific investor or among investors.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.900
Easy right.

01:57.220 --> 02:02.980
All graphs are very easy to create and read once you have identified the type of data you're dealing

02:02.980 --> 02:05.990
with and decided on the best way to visualize it.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.960
Finally we would like to conclude with a very important graph.

02:11.120 --> 02:19.760
The scatterplot this is used when representing two numerical sets of data for this example we have gathered

02:19.760 --> 02:24.220
the reading and writing S.A.T. scores of 100 individuals.

02:24.230 --> 02:27.560
Let me first show you the graph before analyzing it.

02:28.750 --> 02:29.560
All right.

02:29.690 --> 02:35.300
First they say scores are or component range from 200 to 800 points.

02:35.300 --> 02:41.370
That is why our data is bounded within the range of 200 to 800 circuit.

02:41.470 --> 02:48.020
Our vertical axes shows the writing scores while the horizontal axes contains the reading scores.

02:48.020 --> 02:54.530
Third there are 100 students and their results correspond to a specific point on the graph.

02:54.740 --> 02:59.210
Each point gives us information about a particular student's performance.

02:59.810 --> 03:08.240
For example this is Jane she scored 300 on writing but 550 on the reading part scatter plots usually

03:08.240 --> 03:15.200
represent lots and lots of observations when interpreting a scatterplot a statistician is not expected

03:15.200 --> 03:17.530
to look into single data points.

03:17.540 --> 03:24.730
He would be much more interested in getting the main idea of how the data is distributed OK.

03:24.790 --> 03:28.350
The first thing we see is that there is an obvious up trend.

03:28.420 --> 03:33.730
This is because lower writing scores are usually obtained by students with lower reading scores and

03:33.730 --> 03:38.010
higher writing scores have been achieved by students with higher reading scores.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.880
This is logical right.

03:39.880 --> 03:46.320
Students are more likely to do well on both because the two tests are closely related.

03:46.360 --> 03:52.170
Second we notice a concentration of students in the middle of the graph with scores in the region of

03:52.170 --> 03:56.480
450 to 550 on both reading and writing.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.090
Remember that we said that scores could be anywhere between 200 and 800.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.990
Well 500 is the average score one can get.

04:05.010 --> 04:09.040
So it makes sense that a lot of people fall into that area.

04:09.060 --> 04:14.310
Third there is a group of people with both very high writing and reading scores.

04:14.310 --> 04:18.900
The exceptional students tend to be excellent at both components.

04:18.900 --> 04:25.660
This is less true for bad students as their performance tends to deviate when performing different tasks.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.320
Finally we have Jane from a minute ago.

04:28.600 --> 04:35.160
She is far away from every observation as she scored above average on reading but poorly on writing.

04:35.350 --> 04:41.750
This observation is called an outlier as it goes against the logic of the whole dataset.

04:41.800 --> 04:46.910
We will learn more about outliers and how to treat them in our analysis later on in this course.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.600
So we have gone through the basics.

04:50.600 --> 04:56.870
We have covered populations sample's types of variables graphs and tables.

04:56.870 --> 05:03.350
It is time for us to dive into the heart of descriptive statistics measurements of central tendency

05:03.410 --> 05:05.150
and variability.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.170
Thanks for watching.

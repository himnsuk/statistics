00:00.730 --> 00:01.420
OK.

00:01.480 --> 00:02.580
Excellent.

00:02.740 --> 00:08.420
We already know how to create graphs and tables for categorical variables in this lesson.

00:08.430 --> 00:14.830
We're going to do the same for numerical variables and given that numerical data is the main focus of

00:14.830 --> 00:15.690
this course.

00:15.790 --> 00:18.760
We will spend a couple of lessons on this topic.

00:19.730 --> 00:24.880
Now whenever we want to plot data it is best to first order it in a table.

00:25.190 --> 00:31.980
So as we did with categorical variables Let's start by creating a frequency distribution table.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.910
Here's a list of 20 different numbers.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.610
If we arrange them in a frequency table like the one we use for categorical variables we would obtain

00:40.610 --> 00:47.150
a table with 20 rows each of them representing one number of a corresponding frequency of one as each

00:47.150 --> 00:53.610
number occurs exactly one time this table would be impractical for any analysis right.

00:54.450 --> 01:00.960
Well when we deal with numerical variables it makes much more sense to group the data into intervals

01:01.110 --> 01:04.040
and then find the corresponding frequencies.

01:04.440 --> 01:11.200
In this way we make a summary of our data that allows for a meaningful visual representation.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.530
How do we choose these intervals.

01:13.530 --> 01:19.860
Generally statisticians prefer working with the groups of data that contain 5 to 20 intervals.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.400
This way the summary can be useful.

01:23.330 --> 01:29.780
However this varies from case to case and the correct choice of intervals largely depends on the amount

01:29.780 --> 01:33.670
of data we are working with in our example.

01:33.690 --> 01:38.270
We will divide the data into five intervals of equal length.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.880
The simple formula that we use is as follows.

01:42.450 --> 01:49.440
The interval with is equal to the largest number minus the smallest number divided by the number of

01:49.440 --> 01:51.300
desired intervals.

01:51.300 --> 01:57.540
In our case the length of the interval should be 100 minus 1 divided by 5.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.750
The result is nineteen point eight.

02:00.750 --> 02:04.930
Now we want to round this number up in order to reach a neater representation.

02:04.930 --> 02:16.610
Therefore our intervals will be as follows 1 to 21 21 to 41 41 to 61 61 to 81 an 81 to 101.

02:17.010 --> 02:21.470
Each interval has a with of 20 OK.

02:21.800 --> 02:28.700
Let's try to construct the frequency distribution table will have to work with two components intervals

02:28.820 --> 02:31.950
and frequency as we can see from the table.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.540
There are 2 numbers in the first interval.

02:34.580 --> 02:40.750
For in the second three and the third six in the fourth and five in the fifth interval.

02:41.430 --> 02:47.790
For many analysis it is useful to calculate the relative frequency of the data points.

02:47.790 --> 02:54.330
As we said in a previous video the relative frequency is the frequency of a given interval as a part

02:54.330 --> 02:55.710
of the total.

02:55.710 --> 03:00.750
Let's add another column to our table and name it relative frequency.

03:00.750 --> 03:08.880
So the interval from 1 to 20 has an absolute frequency of 2 but a relative frequency of two divided

03:08.880 --> 03:14.680
by the total of 20 numbers which gives us 10 percent and so on as we fill the table.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.690
All right this is how we calculate relative frequencies.

03:19.690 --> 03:23.430
Now that we have summarized the raw data we can start plotting it.

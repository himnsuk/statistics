1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,560
So far we covered graphs that represent only one variable but how do we represent relationships between

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,080
two variables.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,840
In this video we'll explore across tables and scatter plots.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,170
Once again we have a division between categorical and numerical variables.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,390
Let's start with categorical variables.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,860
The most common way to represent them is using cross tables or as some statisticians call them contingency

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,630
tables.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,680
Imagine you are an investment manager and you manage stocks bonds and real estate investments for three

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,360
different investors.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,780
Each of them has a different idea of risk and hence their money is allocated in a different way.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,810
Among the three asset classes across table representing all the data looks in the following way you

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,850
can clearly see the rows showing the different type of investment that's been made and the columns with

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,810
each investor's allocation.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,830
It is good practice to calculate the totals of each row and column as it is often useful in further

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,050
analysis.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,360
Notice that the subtotals of the rows give us total investment in stocks bonds and real estate.

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:18,520
On the other hand the subtotals of the columns gives us the holdings of each investor once we have created

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,740
a cross table we can proceed to visualizing the data onto a plane a very useful chart.

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,320
In such cases is a variation of the bar chart called the side by side bar chart.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,400
It represents the holdings of each investor in the different types of assets.

21
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,540
Stocks are in green.

22
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,860
Bonds are in red.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,230
And real estate is in blue.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,020
The name of this type of chart comes from the fact that for each investor the categories of assets are

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,940
represented side by side.

26
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,900
In this way we can easily compare asset holdings for a specific investor or among investors.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Easy right.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,980
All graphs are very easy to create and read once you have identified the type of data you're dealing

29
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,990
with and decided on the best way to visualize it.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,960
Finally we would like to conclude with a very important graph.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,760
The scatterplot this is used when representing two numerical sets of data for this example we have gathered

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,220
the reading and writing S.A.T. scores of 100 individuals.

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,560
Let me first show you the graph before analyzing it.

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,560
All right.

35
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,300
First they say scores are or component range from 200 to 800 points.

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,370
That is why our data is bounded within the range of 200 to 800 circuit.

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,020
Our vertical axes shows the writing scores while the horizontal axes contains the reading scores.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:54,530
Third there are 100 students and their results correspond to a specific point on the graph.

39
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,210
Each point gives us information about a particular student's performance.

40
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:08,240
For example this is Jane she scored 300 on writing but 550 on the reading part scatter plots usually

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,200
represent lots and lots of observations when interpreting a scatterplot a statistician is not expected

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,530
to look into single data points.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,730
He would be much more interested in getting the main idea of how the data is distributed OK.

44
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,350
The first thing we see is that there is an obvious up trend.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,730
This is because lower writing scores are usually obtained by students with lower reading scores and

46
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,010
higher writing scores have been achieved by students with higher reading scores.

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,880
This is logical right.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,320
Students are more likely to do well on both because the two tests are closely related.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,170
Second we notice a concentration of students in the middle of the graph with scores in the region of

50
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,480
450 to 550 on both reading and writing.

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,090
Remember that we said that scores could be anywhere between 200 and 800.

52
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,990
Well 500 is the average score one can get.

53
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,040
So it makes sense that a lot of people fall into that area.

54
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,310
Third there is a group of people with both very high writing and reading scores.

55
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,900
The exceptional students tend to be excellent at both components.

56
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,660
This is less true for bad students as their performance tends to deviate when performing different tasks.

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,320
Finally we have Jane from a minute ago.

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,160
She is far away from every observation as she scored above average on reading but poorly on writing.

59
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,750
This observation is called an outlier as it goes against the logic of the whole dataset.

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,910
We will learn more about outliers and how to treat them in our analysis later on in this course.

61
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,600
So we have gone through the basics.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,870
We have covered populations sample's types of variables graphs and tables.

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,350
It is time for us to dive into the heart of descriptive statistics measurements of central tendency

64
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,150
and variability.

65
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,170
Thanks for watching.

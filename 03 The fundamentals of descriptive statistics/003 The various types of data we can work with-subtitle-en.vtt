00:00.970 --> 00:05.590
You were probably watching this course because you want to learn the appropriate statistics to perform

00:05.590 --> 00:06.990
different tests.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.340
However before we can start testing we have to get acquainted with the types of variables we usually

00:12.340 --> 00:19.720
encounter different types of variables required different types of statistical tests as such it is key

00:19.720 --> 00:27.100
to be able to classify the data you are working with we can crucify data in two main ways based on its

00:27.100 --> 00:29.770
type and on its measurement level.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.400
Let's start from the types of data we can have.

00:32.470 --> 00:39.220
There is categorical and numerical data categorical data describes categories or groups.

00:39.220 --> 00:45.880
One example is car brands like Mercedes BMW and Audi they show different categories.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.150
Another instance is answers to yes and no questions.

00:49.390 --> 00:56.110
If I ask questions like Are you currently enrolled in a university or do you own a car.

00:56.110 --> 01:00.460
Yes and no would be the two groups of answers that can be obtained.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.740
This is categorical data.

01:02.890 --> 01:07.720
Numerical data on the other hand as its name suggests represents numbers.

01:07.720 --> 01:15.430
It is further divided into two subsets discrete and continuous discrete data can usually be counted

01:15.460 --> 01:17.080
in a finite matter.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.670
A good example would be the number of children that you would want to have.

01:20.890 --> 01:27.130
Even if you don't know exactly how many you were absolutely sure that the value will be an integer such

01:27.130 --> 01:30.490
as 0 1 2 or even 10.

01:30.490 --> 01:33.700
Another instance is grades on the S.A.T. exam.

01:33.970 --> 01:40.920
You may get 1000 1560 1570 or 2400.

01:40.930 --> 01:46.390
What is important for a variable to be defined as discrete is that you can imagine each member of the

01:46.520 --> 01:55.030
dataset knowing that SH scores range from 600 to 2400 and 10 points separate all possible scores that

01:55.030 --> 01:56.720
can be obtained is key.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.790
It's easier to understand discrete data by saying it's the opposite of continuous data continuous data

02:03.880 --> 02:06.760
is infinite and impossible to count.

02:06.790 --> 02:11.710
For instance your weight can take on every value in some range.

02:11.710 --> 02:14.650
Let's dig a bit deeper into this.

02:14.680 --> 02:21.290
You get on the scale and the screen shows 150 pounds or sixty point 0 3 8 9 kilograms.

02:21.430 --> 02:24.060
But this is just an approximation.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.590
If you gain zero point zero one pound the figure on the scale is unlikely to change.

02:29.590 --> 02:35.800
Put your new weight will be one hundred fifty point zero one pounds or sixty eight point zero for three

02:35.800 --> 02:37.390
four kilograms.

02:37.390 --> 02:42.840
Now think about sweating every drop of sweat reduces your weight by the weight of that drop.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.090
But a scale is unlikely to capture that change.

02:46.180 --> 02:50.410
The process of losing and gaining weight occurs all the time.

02:50.410 --> 02:53.290
Your exact weight is a continuous variable.

02:53.380 --> 02:59.090
It can take on an infinite amount of values no matter how many digits there are after the dot.

02:59.110 --> 03:06.070
To sum it up your weight can vary by incomprehensibly small amounts and is continuous while the number

03:06.070 --> 03:11.130
of children you want to have is directly understandable and is discrete.

03:11.560 --> 03:15.560
Alright these were the types of data in our next lesson.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.800
We will explore the levels of measurement.

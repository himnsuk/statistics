00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,210
The most common graph used to represent numerical data is the histogram first we'll learn how to create

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,330
it and then we'll provide a description of the way the data is represented.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,420
We are going to use the frequency distribution table from our previous example to help us.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,320
Here it is as you can see it looks like a bar chart but actually conveys very different information

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,250
as in the bar chart.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,440
The vertical axis is the numerical type and shows the absolute frequency.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,780
This time though the horizontal axes is numerical 2.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,130
To use the other classification we already know it is quantitative data of the interval type.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,520
All right so each bar has with equal to the interval and height equal to the frequency.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,490
Notice how the different bars are touching.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,580
This is to show that there is continuation between the intervals each interval ends where the next one

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,990
starts in the bar chart.

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,520
However different bars represented different categories.

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,000
So the bars were completely separate ok.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,360
Sometimes it is useful to plot the intervals against the relative rather than the absolute frequency

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,900
as you can see the histogram looks the same visually but gives different information to the audience

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,890
remember relative frequency is made up of percentages.

18
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,220
There is one last thing to note here.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,760
We may create a histogram with an equal intervals.

20
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,490
An example is designing age groups.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,690
You've likely completed some survey where you were asked about your age and the possible answers were

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,770
18 to 25 then 25 to 30 30 to 35 and so on until 60 plus clearly the interval widths vary and reflect

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,850
different focus groups for the experiment at hand.

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,340
An explanation for this choice may be young adults under-25 cannot afford the product while adults over

25
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,940
60 have no interest in the product.

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,610
In any case you should be quite experienced to accurately design and interpret such groups.

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,860
It is highly recommended that you stick with the equal with intervals until you gain enough experience.

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,660
OK great this is how we can build a histogram in order to represent numerical data.

29
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,520
Stay tuned for our next lesson where we will see graphs that allow us to observe the relationship between

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
variables.

1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,420
OK.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,580
Excellent.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,420
We already know how to create graphs and tables for categorical variables in this lesson.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,830
We're going to do the same for numerical variables and given that numerical data is the main focus of

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,690
this course.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,760
We will spend a couple of lessons on this topic.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,880
Now whenever we want to plot data it is best to first order it in a table.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,980
So as we did with categorical variables Let's start by creating a frequency distribution table.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,910
Here's a list of 20 different numbers.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,610
If we arrange them in a frequency table like the one we use for categorical variables we would obtain

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:47,150
a table with 20 rows each of them representing one number of a corresponding frequency of one as each

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,610
number occurs exactly one time this table would be impractical for any analysis right.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,960
Well when we deal with numerical variables it makes much more sense to group the data into intervals

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,040
and then find the corresponding frequencies.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,200
In this way we make a summary of our data that allows for a meaningful visual representation.

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,530
How do we choose these intervals.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,860
Generally statisticians prefer working with the groups of data that contain 5 to 20 intervals.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,400
This way the summary can be useful.

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,780
However this varies from case to case and the correct choice of intervals largely depends on the amount

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,670
of data we are working with in our example.

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,270
We will divide the data into five intervals of equal length.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,880
The simple formula that we use is as follows.

23
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,440
The interval with is equal to the largest number minus the smallest number divided by the number of

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,300
desired intervals.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,540
In our case the length of the interval should be 100 minus 1 divided by 5.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,750
The result is nineteen point eight.

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,930
Now we want to round this number up in order to reach a neater representation.

28
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:16,610
Therefore our intervals will be as follows 1 to 21 21 to 41 41 to 61 61 to 81 an 81 to 101.

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,470
Each interval has a with of 20 OK.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,700
Let's try to construct the frequency distribution table will have to work with two components intervals

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,950
and frequency as we can see from the table.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,540
There are 2 numbers in the first interval.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,750
For in the second three and the third six in the fourth and five in the fifth interval.

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,790
For many analysis it is useful to calculate the relative frequency of the data points.

35
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,330
As we said in a previous video the relative frequency is the frequency of a given interval as a part

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,710
of the total.

37
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,750
Let's add another column to our table and name it relative frequency.

38
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,880
So the interval from 1 to 20 has an absolute frequency of 2 but a relative frequency of two divided

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,680
by the total of 20 numbers which gives us 10 percent and so on as we fill the table.

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,690
All right this is how we calculate relative frequencies.

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,430
Now that we have summarized the raw data we can start plotting it.

00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,590
You were probably watching this course because you want to learn the appropriate statistics to perform

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,990
different tests.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,340
However before we can start testing we have to get acquainted with the types of variables we usually

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:19,720
encounter different types of variables required different types of statistical tests as such it is key

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:27,100
to be able to classify the data you are working with we can crucify data in two main ways based on its

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,770
type and on its measurement level.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,400
Let's start from the types of data we can have.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:39,220
There is categorical and numerical data categorical data describes categories or groups.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,880
One example is car brands like Mercedes BMW and Audi they show different categories.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,150
Another instance is answers to yes and no questions.

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:56,110
If I ask questions like Are you currently enrolled in a university or do you own a car.

12
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,460
Yes and no would be the two groups of answers that can be obtained.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,740
This is categorical data.

14
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,720
Numerical data on the other hand as its name suggests represents numbers.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,430
It is further divided into two subsets discrete and continuous discrete data can usually be counted

16
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,080
in a finite matter.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,670
A good example would be the number of children that you would want to have.

18
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,130
Even if you don't know exactly how many you were absolutely sure that the value will be an integer such

19
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,490
as 0 1 2 or even 10.

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,700
Another instance is grades on the S.A.T. exam.

21
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,920
You may get 1000 1560 1570 or 2400.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,390
What is important for a variable to be defined as discrete is that you can imagine each member of the

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:55,030
dataset knowing that SH scores range from 600 to 2400 and 10 points separate all possible scores that

24
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,720
can be obtained is key.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,790
It's easier to understand discrete data by saying it's the opposite of continuous data continuous data

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,760
is infinite and impossible to count.

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,710
For instance your weight can take on every value in some range.

28
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,650
Let's dig a bit deeper into this.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,290
You get on the scale and the screen shows 150 pounds or sixty point 0 3 8 9 kilograms.

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,060
But this is just an approximation.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,590
If you gain zero point zero one pound the figure on the scale is unlikely to change.

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,800
Put your new weight will be one hundred fifty point zero one pounds or sixty eight point zero for three

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,390
four kilograms.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,840
Now think about sweating every drop of sweat reduces your weight by the weight of that drop.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,090
But a scale is unlikely to capture that change.

36
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,410
The process of losing and gaining weight occurs all the time.

37
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,290
Your exact weight is a continuous variable.

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,090
It can take on an infinite amount of values no matter how many digits there are after the dot.

39
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,070
To sum it up your weight can vary by incomprehensibly small amounts and is continuous while the number

40
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,130
of children you want to have is directly understandable and is discrete.

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Alright these were the types of data in our next lesson.

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,800
We will explore the levels of measurement.

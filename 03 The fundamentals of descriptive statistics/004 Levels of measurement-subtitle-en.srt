1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,740
In our previous video we distinguish between categorical and numerical data.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,170
Furthermore we saw that numerical data can be discrete and continuous.

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,210
It's time to move on to the other classification levels of measurement.

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,310
These can be split into two groups qualitative and quantitative data.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,850
They are very intuitive.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,940
So don't worry qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal nominal values or like the categories we talked

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:38,830
about just now Mercedes BMW or Audi or like the four seasons Winter spring summer and autumn they are

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,630
numbers and cannot be put in any order.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,680
Ordinal data on the other hand consists of groups and categories but follows a strict order.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,120
Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are disgusting.

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,750
Unappetising neutral tasty and delicious although we have words and not numbers.

12
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,900
It is obvious that these preferences are ordered from negative to positive.

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,220
Thus the data is qualitative ordinal.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,200
OK so what about quantitative variables.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,580
Well as you may have guessed by now they are split into two groups interval and ratio intervals and

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,020
ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference ratios have a true zero and intervals

17
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,240
don't.

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,010
For example length is a ratio variable.

19
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,370
You all know that 0 inches or 0 feet means no length with temperature.

20
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,630
However we have a different story.

21
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,320
It is usually an interval variable.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,610
Let me explain.

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,960
Usually it is expressed in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,650
They are both interval variables zero degrees Celsius or zero degrees Fahrenheit don't mean anything

25
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,250
as the absolute zero temperature is actually negative 273 point fifteen degrees Celsius or negative

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,500
four hundred fifty nine point sixty seven degrees Fahrenheit.

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,520
However we can easily say that 80 degrees Fahrenheit is less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:19,140
In the case of interval variables the difference is meaningful but the zero is not continuing this temperature

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,000
example.

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,650
There is a nother scale Kelvins.

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,900
According to it the absolute minimum temperature is zero degrees Kelvin.

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,630
Therefore if the degrees are stated in Kelvins the variable will be a ratio.

33
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:41,840
So numbers like two three ten ten point five pi etc. can be both an interval or a ratio measurement.

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,990
But you have to be careful with the context you are using them in.

35
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,440
All right we've quickly gone through the types of data and the measurement levels.

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,150
Stick around to see the types of graphs that are used on a daily basis when performing statistical analysis.

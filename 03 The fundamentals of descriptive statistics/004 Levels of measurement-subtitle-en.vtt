00:00.880 --> 00:05.740
In our previous video we distinguish between categorical and numerical data.

00:05.740 --> 00:11.170
Furthermore we saw that numerical data can be discrete and continuous.

00:11.170 --> 00:16.210
It's time to move on to the other classification levels of measurement.

00:16.210 --> 00:21.310
These can be split into two groups qualitative and quantitative data.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.850
They are very intuitive.

00:22.900 --> 00:30.940
So don't worry qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal nominal values or like the categories we talked

00:30.940 --> 00:38.830
about just now Mercedes BMW or Audi or like the four seasons Winter spring summer and autumn they are

00:38.860 --> 00:41.630
numbers and cannot be put in any order.

00:42.470 --> 00:48.680
Ordinal data on the other hand consists of groups and categories but follows a strict order.

00:48.680 --> 00:54.120
Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are disgusting.

00:54.140 --> 01:00.750
Unappetising neutral tasty and delicious although we have words and not numbers.

01:00.770 --> 01:04.900
It is obvious that these preferences are ordered from negative to positive.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.220
Thus the data is qualitative ordinal.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.200
OK so what about quantitative variables.

01:12.200 --> 01:19.580
Well as you may have guessed by now they are split into two groups interval and ratio intervals and

01:19.580 --> 01:27.020
ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference ratios have a true zero and intervals

01:27.050 --> 01:28.240
don't.

01:28.370 --> 01:32.010
For example length is a ratio variable.

01:32.060 --> 01:37.370
You all know that 0 inches or 0 feet means no length with temperature.

01:37.370 --> 01:39.630
However we have a different story.

01:39.650 --> 01:42.320
It is usually an interval variable.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.610
Let me explain.

01:44.030 --> 01:47.960
Usually it is expressed in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

01:48.020 --> 01:54.650
They are both interval variables zero degrees Celsius or zero degrees Fahrenheit don't mean anything

01:54.830 --> 02:01.250
as the absolute zero temperature is actually negative 273 point fifteen degrees Celsius or negative

02:01.250 --> 02:05.500
four hundred fifty nine point sixty seven degrees Fahrenheit.

02:05.520 --> 02:11.520
However we can easily say that 80 degrees Fahrenheit is less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

02:11.820 --> 02:19.140
In the case of interval variables the difference is meaningful but the zero is not continuing this temperature

02:19.140 --> 02:20.000
example.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.650
There is a nother scale Kelvins.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.900
According to it the absolute minimum temperature is zero degrees Kelvin.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.630
Therefore if the degrees are stated in Kelvins the variable will be a ratio.

02:33.630 --> 02:41.840
So numbers like two three ten ten point five pi etc. can be both an interval or a ratio measurement.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.990
But you have to be careful with the context you are using them in.

02:46.050 --> 02:50.440
All right we've quickly gone through the types of data and the measurement levels.

02:50.520 --> 02:56.150
Stick around to see the types of graphs that are used on a daily basis when performing statistical analysis.

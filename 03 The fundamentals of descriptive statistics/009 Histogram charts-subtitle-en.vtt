The most common graph used to represent numerical data is the histogram first we'll learn how to create

00:07.210 --> 00:11.330
it and then we'll provide a description of the way the data is represented.

00:11.380 --> 00:16.420
We are going to use the frequency distribution table from our previous example to help us.

00:16.660 --> 00:23.320
Here it is as you can see it looks like a bar chart but actually conveys very different information

00:23.950 --> 00:25.250
as in the bar chart.

00:25.330 --> 00:30.440
The vertical axis is the numerical type and shows the absolute frequency.

00:30.550 --> 00:34.780
This time though the horizontal axes is numerical 2.

00:34.930 --> 00:41.130
To use the other classification we already know it is quantitative data of the interval type.

00:41.260 --> 00:47.520
All right so each bar has with equal to the interval and height equal to the frequency.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.490
Notice how the different bars are touching.

00:50.520 --> 00:56.580
This is to show that there is continuation between the intervals each interval ends where the next one

00:56.580 --> 00:58.990
starts in the bar chart.

00:59.010 --> 01:02.520
However different bars represented different categories.

01:02.580 --> 01:07.000
So the bars were completely separate ok.

01:07.070 --> 01:13.360
Sometimes it is useful to plot the intervals against the relative rather than the absolute frequency

01:14.170 --> 01:19.900
as you can see the histogram looks the same visually but gives different information to the audience

01:20.470 --> 01:24.890
remember relative frequency is made up of percentages.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.220
There is one last thing to note here.

01:28.290 --> 01:31.760
We may create a histogram with an equal intervals.

01:31.770 --> 01:34.490
An example is designing age groups.

01:34.710 --> 01:39.690
You've likely completed some survey where you were asked about your age and the possible answers were

01:40.200 --> 01:49.770
18 to 25 then 25 to 30 30 to 35 and so on until 60 plus clearly the interval widths vary and reflect

01:49.770 --> 01:52.850
different focus groups for the experiment at hand.

01:52.890 --> 01:59.340
An explanation for this choice may be young adults under-25 cannot afford the product while adults over

01:59.340 --> 02:01.940
60 have no interest in the product.

02:01.980 --> 02:07.610
In any case you should be quite experienced to accurately design and interpret such groups.

02:07.710 --> 02:13.860
It is highly recommended that you stick with the equal with intervals until you gain enough experience.

02:14.290 --> 02:20.660
OK great this is how we can build a histogram in order to represent numerical data.

02:20.670 --> 02:26.520
Stay tuned for our next lesson where we will see graphs that allow us to observe the relationship between

02:26.520 --> 02:27.240
variables.

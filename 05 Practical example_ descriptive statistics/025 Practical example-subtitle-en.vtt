00:00.650 --> 00:07.220
Finally it's time for the practical example we've been talking about in this lesson we will see an actual

00:07.220 --> 00:11.540
database of a real estate company operating in California.

00:11.540 --> 00:15.960
All right we're interested in the statistical properties of the data.

00:16.010 --> 00:22.050
That is why we have reordered the database and cherry picked variable than imported DS in a spreadsheet.

00:22.370 --> 00:26.960
The labels of the columns have been made friendly even for those of you who have no experience with

00:26.960 --> 00:28.300
real estate.

00:28.310 --> 00:33.060
Finally we have altered the names of the customers for confidentiality reasons.

00:33.410 --> 00:34.300
OK.

00:34.490 --> 00:39.600
The company is launching a marketing campaign but it wants to target its audience properly.

00:39.710 --> 00:45.920
The management suspects after some shore analysis marketing results can be improved without the need

00:45.920 --> 00:48.720
of investing additional resources.

00:48.770 --> 00:54.440
We are the data analysis who are going to crunch some numbers and identify which groups of people are

00:54.440 --> 00:56.720
most likely to buy our product.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.600
Once we have done so we will instruct the marketing team to focus its efforts on these groups.

01:03.080 --> 01:08.220
The first thing we have to do when we analyze data is get acquainted with the table.

01:08.240 --> 01:12.260
It illustrates the skills of real estate property for a specific company.

01:12.350 --> 01:16.520
Lets call it 365 data sites real estate Calif..

01:16.550 --> 01:20.040
Hopefully no one else thought of that name.

01:20.070 --> 01:25.650
Second the table has two parts left and right on the left hand side.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.910
We have product information on the right hand side.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.780
We have customer information.

01:30.920 --> 01:37.340
You can easily spot all products are listed but customer information is only available for some products.

01:37.340 --> 01:44.390
This is because we input information about a customer once the deal is done logically only sold items

01:44.390 --> 01:46.540
are associated with a buyer.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.740
Lets see what a roll looks like.

01:48.740 --> 01:57.260
This should clear up the logic of the table for you Nora Lynch with a customer id see 0 0 0 4 was 56

01:57.290 --> 02:01.410
years old when she bought a apartment 43 in building one to live there.

02:01.520 --> 02:07.920
She paid three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred thirteen dollars for an area of 1000 160

02:07.970 --> 02:08.710
square feet.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.920
In June 2004 Nora is from California.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.350
Felt very satisfied with the deal and did not get a mortgage for the purchase.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.520
She found out about our product through our website.

02:20.930 --> 02:26.410
Okay now that that's out of the way we need to dig deeper into these variables.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.770
We will identify types of data and levels of measurement for some of them.

02:30.770 --> 02:34.040
This is a crucial step as we cannot analyze the data.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.460
If we don't understand its type.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.750
Lets start from the first column ID.

02:39.770 --> 02:45.110
ID is a value we assign to each item that lets us differentiate between products.

02:45.140 --> 02:51.060
It may look numerical to you but it is categorical that's counter-intuitive the first time.

02:51.110 --> 02:52.810
So let's clarify it.

02:52.820 --> 02:58.460
What if we use names like John John to John 3 and so on until John N.

02:58.490 --> 03:04.300
The meaning would not change id variables are like names we assign to different products.

03:04.310 --> 03:10.650
However it is much easier to use numbers as unlike names we have an infinite number of numbers.

03:11.580 --> 03:17.180
A simple way to check if a variable is numerical or categorical is to interpret its mean.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.170
Think about it.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.840
The mean ID number shows nothing.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.640
Now oppose this to the mean price.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.250
The mean price is a valuable piece of information.

03:27.270 --> 03:32.250
OK the bottom line is ID is a categorical variable.

03:32.390 --> 03:34.230
What about its level of measurement.

03:34.460 --> 03:37.240
Well it is qualitative nominal.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.270
Clear.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.410
Clear.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.580
The next variable we must examine is age.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.650
Age is rather interesting.

03:44.750 --> 03:48.080
The level of measurement is quantitative ratio.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.960
A rule used for verifying ratios is asking the question.

03:52.070 --> 03:54.190
Is there a true zero point.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.420
Well for age when you are born you are exactly zero years old.

03:59.420 --> 04:01.230
That's the true zero point.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.380
So we are safe.

04:03.540 --> 04:10.540
However once intriguing is whether age is discrete or continuous It may be both.

04:10.620 --> 04:14.030
In this case we can only see age as a whole number.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.940
Therefore it is discrete.

04:16.050 --> 04:20.710
However similar to weight of variable we discussed earlier in this course.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.230
Age is a continuous variable.

04:23.520 --> 04:30.660
When I am recording this the Statue of Liberty is 131 years old but I may get more specific by saying

04:30.660 --> 04:36.770
it is 131 years and 11 months old or its age is 131 92.

04:36.960 --> 04:42.910
If I had days minutes and seconds I'll get 131 nine thousand four hundred twelve.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.460
You get the point when dealing with age.

04:45.510 --> 04:49.690
You decide it's time depending on your work at hand.

04:49.870 --> 04:52.930
The next variable we have is age interval.

04:52.930 --> 04:55.720
This is yet another way to represent age.

04:55.750 --> 05:02.410
Once again it is continuous or discrete as we are talking about the same variable This time though the

05:02.410 --> 05:08.680
level of measurement is ordinal instead of a ratio the age groups represent different categories ordered

05:08.830 --> 05:10.660
but are not numerical.

05:10.660 --> 05:16.180
This shows that the same variable can have different levels of measurement within the same database.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.770
All right let's move on.

05:19.800 --> 05:26.730
In most corporate analysis price is Central no matter the data set it is always a numerical variable

05:26.880 --> 05:31.940
that like age may be discrete or continuous depending on your needs.

05:31.980 --> 05:37.280
If you are interested banks and corporations treat it as continuous and so will we.

05:37.470 --> 05:41.200
The level of measurement here is ratio.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.270
The next variable we want to look into is gender.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.470
It is of categorical type and its level of measurement is nominal.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.920
It is similar to the yes no questions discussed in a previous lesson.

05:52.980 --> 05:57.370
Such variables are called binary as there are only two possibilities.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.920
Finally let's check out the location.

06:00.980 --> 06:05.250
We will discuss state in more detail and leave country for homework.

06:05.300 --> 06:09.040
The state variable refers to sales in the USA only.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.510
Note that only if the country input is USA.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.060
Would we have a value for state.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.920
State is a categorical variable like ID.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.370
We talked about earlier.

06:19.490 --> 06:23.760
You can label the US states from 1 to 50 and news numbers instead.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.820
Either way the variable is categorical and its level of measurement is nominal.

06:30.370 --> 06:33.000
OK excellent.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.950
We've categorized the variables we will use in this video.

06:36.950 --> 06:43.010
This spreadsheet is available for you in the resources section with the exercises we've prepared on

06:43.010 --> 06:43.940
this database.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.790
You can practice the entire section about descriptive statistics.

06:48.960 --> 06:55.740
All right back to our problem at hand we must identify the groups of people who buy the most of our

06:55.740 --> 06:56.720
product.

06:56.730 --> 07:00.400
Let's start with gender before we can plot the data.

07:00.450 --> 07:04.570
We must create the frequency distribution table in the course notes.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.850
You can see how that's done in Excel.

07:06.960 --> 07:12.320
However in this video I'll skip this step and get to the frequency distribution table.

07:12.600 --> 07:19.190
Now we have three possibilities for gender male female or a cell where gender is not available.

07:19.260 --> 07:23.760
Since some properties were purchased by companies they have no gender.

07:23.760 --> 07:29.190
We have to include them in the analysis or explain why we omitted in the report.

07:29.190 --> 07:31.110
Gender is categorical.

07:31.140 --> 07:35.540
We said that a good way to represent it in practice is with a pie chart.

07:35.920 --> 07:40.020
OK we can clearly see most clients are male.

07:40.020 --> 07:47.030
However this information is biased as the customers in this database are the people who signed the contract.

07:47.100 --> 07:53.370
It is likely a family bought the apartment but our data shows us only the person who signed the contract.

07:53.400 --> 07:59.610
Such variables are interesting to see but it is not a good idea to include them in the data driven decisions

07:59.610 --> 08:00.960
we make.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.850
OK let's carry on with location.

08:04.020 --> 08:09.370
What chart would be useful to show this state is a categorical variable.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.400
We may use a bar chart or a pie chart.

08:12.450 --> 08:18.680
However I prefer the Pareto diagram as it gives additional information from the graph.

08:18.690 --> 08:19.890
You can immediately see.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.210
Most clients are from California.

08:22.290 --> 08:28.080
A possible scenario is to invest in marketing for the Top 75 percent of the locations.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.870
This will mean we can focus on California and Nevada alone.

08:32.890 --> 08:35.530
Next we want to see age.

08:35.530 --> 08:40.890
First we have to note that age represents the age of the buyer when the deal was sealed.

08:40.990 --> 08:47.220
The formula used is the year of the deal minus the year of the birth of the buyer.

08:47.240 --> 08:52.510
We are doing this because we want to see the age at which customers buy our product.

08:52.510 --> 08:54.790
Their current age is irrelevant.

08:54.790 --> 08:58.600
Real estate is something people rarely buy more than once in their life.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.740
So age will probably be a central variable in our analysis.

09:03.880 --> 09:09.740
Let's first Plup the frequency distribution of age this is done by creating a histogram with an interval

09:09.740 --> 09:11.720
length of one.

09:11.730 --> 09:15.860
Now we can move on to the age interval representation.

09:15.860 --> 09:28.460
The options are 18 to 25 26 to 35 36 to 45 56 to 65 and 65 plus most of the data falls between 25 and

09:28.460 --> 09:32.670
60 years which is evident from the frequency distribution graph.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.940
Therefore our intervals are a good fit of the data.

09:36.950 --> 09:41.320
Let's build a new histogram based on them done.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.570
This representation is much neater isn't it.

09:44.570 --> 09:50.930
We can clearly see 36 to 45 is the age at which most people purchase a real estate property.

09:50.930 --> 09:58.800
It is evident that customers from 26 to 65 years old account for 71 percent of our observations.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.740
But we are better than this.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.250
We can calculate more statistics to get an improved idea can't we.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.770
Let's do it.

10:06.770 --> 10:13.850
The mean median and mode are the place where we usually start the mean age is forty six point fifteen

10:13.850 --> 10:19.380
years the median age is 45 years and the mode is 48 years.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.380
All right.

10:20.570 --> 10:22.630
The mean and median are close.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.790
So we have few outliers as you may recall.

10:25.820 --> 10:31.770
The mean is affected by them while the median is not when the mean is higher than the median.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.090
We have a positive or right skew.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.900
This is confirmed by our histogram.

10:37.070 --> 10:42.890
Now is the time to remind you that skewness shows too which side is the longer tail not where the data

10:42.890 --> 10:44.590
is concentrated.

10:44.720 --> 10:51.680
Now for the mode we have 48 years you can see that from the frequency distribution graph but not from

10:51.680 --> 10:52.630
the histogram.

10:52.790 --> 10:58.790
The histogram bundles data together which is good when we want to see the main trend but some information

10:58.790 --> 11:01.190
like the mode is lost.

11:01.190 --> 11:06.620
Finally we should inspect the variability of age before we can do so.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.330
We have to see if this is sample or population data.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.980
The company data is the population of all people who are our customers.

11:15.140 --> 11:20.870
However our research aims to help the marketing department identify future customers.

11:20.900 --> 11:27.110
Therefore our dataset is a sample drawn from all the people who will eventually buy property from our

11:27.110 --> 11:28.080
company.

11:28.370 --> 11:31.530
Henceforth we will use sample formulas.

11:31.550 --> 11:35.360
Let's compute both the variance and the standard deviation.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.980
The former is measured in squared years and the latter in years.

11:39.980 --> 11:44.630
So I suggest we stick with the standard deviation then shall we.

11:44.630 --> 11:47.260
The result is around 13 years.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.310
This shows us how dispersed the data is.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.500
What inferences can we make from this result.

11:53.750 --> 11:58.570
Well that's the topic of the next section so we all have to halt here.

11:58.910 --> 12:03.420
As you may have guessed our final stop is relationship between variables.

12:03.590 --> 12:08.380
Let's see if age determines how expensive an apartment that customers buy.

12:08.780 --> 12:13.100
Maybe younger people have less funds so they buy cheaper apartments.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.430
We don't know the data will tell us first things first.

12:17.540 --> 12:23.670
Let's plop the data both variables are numerical so we must use a scatter plot.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.020
Here it is.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.370
It is dispersed and there isn't an obvious trend.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.200
Let's confirm this observation by calculating the covariance of the two variables.

12:33.260 --> 12:36.580
We get this enormous value that doesn't tell us much.

12:36.620 --> 12:41.020
So it's suitable to standardize it by using the correlation coefficient.

12:41.060 --> 12:46.070
The value we get is minus 0.17 much better.

12:46.070 --> 12:48.080
This correlation is low.

12:48.290 --> 12:54.760
A common practice is to disregard correlations that are below zero point to Alright.

12:54.850 --> 13:00.210
So real estate expenditure is not related to age from a previous lesson.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.720
We know price and size are much more likely to be correlated right.

13:04.830 --> 13:08.130
You have all the tools needed to check this through the exercise.

13:08.130 --> 13:15.300
After this lesson so we've exhausted our statistical knowledge what can we tell the marketing team after

13:15.300 --> 13:16.950
this short analysis.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.080
Well we got several insights.

13:20.220 --> 13:26.750
First males are more likely to sign contracts and are potentially a better audience for our ads.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.600
However we have no information about their marital status.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.280
This observation is unclear.

13:33.300 --> 13:41.370
Second 68 percent of our sales in the US come from California with Nevada Oregon Arizona and Colorado

13:41.380 --> 13:49.390
following behind to form 93 percent of the US customer base third 71 percent of sales were made with

13:49.390 --> 13:57.130
customers aged between 26 and 55 years old with a mean of 46 years of age and a standard deviation of

13:57.130 --> 13:58.540
13 years.

13:58.540 --> 14:05.700
The distribution is right skewed so we expect younger people to buy more property than older people.

14:05.700 --> 14:11.810
Finally there is no relationship between the age of a customer and the price they will pay.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.280
All right that was our practical example.

14:15.280 --> 14:21.500
We learned a lot about this business but we could not get amazing insights in the following sections.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.270
We will learn about confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

14:25.270 --> 14:29.950
This knowledge will provide us with the tools we need to make predictions about the future and make

14:29.950 --> 14:31.700
data driven decisions.

14:32.020 --> 14:35.980
Oh and one more thing if you like the course so far.

14:35.980 --> 14:37.500
Please leave us a review.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.900
It helps a lot.

14:38.980 --> 14:41.250
Thanks for practicing and thanks for watching.

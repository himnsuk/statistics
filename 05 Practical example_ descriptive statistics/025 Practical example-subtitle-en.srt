1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,220
Finally it's time for the practical example we've been talking about in this lesson we will see an actual

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,540
database of a real estate company operating in California.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,960
All right we're interested in the statistical properties of the data.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,050
That is why we have reordered the database and cherry picked variable than imported DS in a spreadsheet.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,960
The labels of the columns have been made friendly even for those of you who have no experience with

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,300
real estate.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,060
Finally we have altered the names of the customers for confidentiality reasons.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,300
OK.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,600
The company is launching a marketing campaign but it wants to target its audience properly.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,920
The management suspects after some shore analysis marketing results can be improved without the need

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,720
of investing additional resources.

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,440
We are the data analysis who are going to crunch some numbers and identify which groups of people are

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,720
most likely to buy our product.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,600
Once we have done so we will instruct the marketing team to focus its efforts on these groups.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,220
The first thing we have to do when we analyze data is get acquainted with the table.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,260
It illustrates the skills of real estate property for a specific company.

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,520
Lets call it 365 data sites real estate Calif..

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,040
Hopefully no one else thought of that name.

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,650
Second the table has two parts left and right on the left hand side.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,910
We have product information on the right hand side.

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,780
We have customer information.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,340
You can easily spot all products are listed but customer information is only available for some products.

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,390
This is because we input information about a customer once the deal is done logically only sold items

24
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,540
are associated with a buyer.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,740
Lets see what a roll looks like.

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:57,260
This should clear up the logic of the table for you Nora Lynch with a customer id see 0 0 0 4 was 56

27
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,410
years old when she bought a apartment 43 in building one to live there.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,920
She paid three hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred thirteen dollars for an area of 1000 160

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,710
square feet.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,920
In June 2004 Nora is from California.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,350
Felt very satisfied with the deal and did not get a mortgage for the purchase.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,520
She found out about our product through our website.

33
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,410
Okay now that that's out of the way we need to dig deeper into these variables.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,770
We will identify types of data and levels of measurement for some of them.

35
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,040
This is a crucial step as we cannot analyze the data.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,460
If we don't understand its type.

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,750
Lets start from the first column ID.

38
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,110
ID is a value we assign to each item that lets us differentiate between products.

39
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,060
It may look numerical to you but it is categorical that's counter-intuitive the first time.

40
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,810
So let's clarify it.

41
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,460
What if we use names like John John to John 3 and so on until John N.

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,300
The meaning would not change id variables are like names we assign to different products.

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,650
However it is much easier to use numbers as unlike names we have an infinite number of numbers.

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,180
A simple way to check if a variable is numerical or categorical is to interpret its mean.

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,170
Think about it.

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,840
The mean ID number shows nothing.

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,640
Now oppose this to the mean price.

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,250
The mean price is a valuable piece of information.

49
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,250
OK the bottom line is ID is a categorical variable.

50
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,230
What about its level of measurement.

51
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,240
Well it is qualitative nominal.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,270
Clear.

53
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,410
Clear.

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,580
The next variable we must examine is age.

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,650
Age is rather interesting.

56
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,080
The level of measurement is quantitative ratio.

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,960
A rule used for verifying ratios is asking the question.

58
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,190
Is there a true zero point.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,420
Well for age when you are born you are exactly zero years old.

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,230
That's the true zero point.

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,380
So we are safe.

62
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,540
However once intriguing is whether age is discrete or continuous It may be both.

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,030
In this case we can only see age as a whole number.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,940
Therefore it is discrete.

65
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,710
However similar to weight of variable we discussed earlier in this course.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,230
Age is a continuous variable.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,660
When I am recording this the Statue of Liberty is 131 years old but I may get more specific by saying

68
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,770
it is 131 years and 11 months old or its age is 131 92.

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,910
If I had days minutes and seconds I'll get 131 nine thousand four hundred twelve.

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,460
You get the point when dealing with age.

71
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,690
You decide it's time depending on your work at hand.

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,930
The next variable we have is age interval.

73
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,720
This is yet another way to represent age.

74
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,410
Once again it is continuous or discrete as we are talking about the same variable This time though the

75
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,680
level of measurement is ordinal instead of a ratio the age groups represent different categories ordered

76
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,660
but are not numerical.

77
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,180
This shows that the same variable can have different levels of measurement within the same database.

78
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,770
All right let's move on.

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,730
In most corporate analysis price is Central no matter the data set it is always a numerical variable

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,940
that like age may be discrete or continuous depending on your needs.

81
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,280
If you are interested banks and corporations treat it as continuous and so will we.

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,200
The level of measurement here is ratio.

83
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,270
The next variable we want to look into is gender.

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,470
It is of categorical type and its level of measurement is nominal.

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,920
It is similar to the yes no questions discussed in a previous lesson.

86
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,370
Such variables are called binary as there are only two possibilities.

87
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,920
Finally let's check out the location.

88
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,250
We will discuss state in more detail and leave country for homework.

89
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,040
The state variable refers to sales in the USA only.

90
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,510
Note that only if the country input is USA.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,060
Would we have a value for state.

92
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,920
State is a categorical variable like ID.

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,370
We talked about earlier.

94
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,760
You can label the US states from 1 to 50 and news numbers instead.

95
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,820
Either way the variable is categorical and its level of measurement is nominal.

96
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,000
OK excellent.

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,950
We've categorized the variables we will use in this video.

98
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,010
This spreadsheet is available for you in the resources section with the exercises we've prepared on

99
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,940
this database.

100
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,790
You can practice the entire section about descriptive statistics.

101
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,740
All right back to our problem at hand we must identify the groups of people who buy the most of our

102
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,720
product.

103
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,400
Let's start with gender before we can plot the data.

104
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,570
We must create the frequency distribution table in the course notes.

105
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,850
You can see how that's done in Excel.

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,320
However in this video I'll skip this step and get to the frequency distribution table.

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,190
Now we have three possibilities for gender male female or a cell where gender is not available.

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,760
Since some properties were purchased by companies they have no gender.

109
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,190
We have to include them in the analysis or explain why we omitted in the report.

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,110
Gender is categorical.

111
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,540
We said that a good way to represent it in practice is with a pie chart.

112
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,020
OK we can clearly see most clients are male.

113
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,030
However this information is biased as the customers in this database are the people who signed the contract.

114
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,370
It is likely a family bought the apartment but our data shows us only the person who signed the contract.

115
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,610
Such variables are interesting to see but it is not a good idea to include them in the data driven decisions

116
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,960
we make.

117
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,850
OK let's carry on with location.

118
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,370
What chart would be useful to show this state is a categorical variable.

119
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,400
We may use a bar chart or a pie chart.

120
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:18,680
However I prefer the Pareto diagram as it gives additional information from the graph.

121
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,890
You can immediately see.

122
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,210
Most clients are from California.

123
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,080
A possible scenario is to invest in marketing for the Top 75 percent of the locations.

124
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,870
This will mean we can focus on California and Nevada alone.

125
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,530
Next we want to see age.

126
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,890
First we have to note that age represents the age of the buyer when the deal was sealed.

127
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,220
The formula used is the year of the deal minus the year of the birth of the buyer.

128
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,510
We are doing this because we want to see the age at which customers buy our product.

129
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,790
Their current age is irrelevant.

130
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,600
Real estate is something people rarely buy more than once in their life.

131
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,740
So age will probably be a central variable in our analysis.

132
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,740
Let's first Plup the frequency distribution of age this is done by creating a histogram with an interval

133
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,720
length of one.

134
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,860
Now we can move on to the age interval representation.

135
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:28,460
The options are 18 to 25 26 to 35 36 to 45 56 to 65 and 65 plus most of the data falls between 25 and

136
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,670
60 years which is evident from the frequency distribution graph.

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,940
Therefore our intervals are a good fit of the data.

138
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,320
Let's build a new histogram based on them done.

139
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,570
This representation is much neater isn't it.

140
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,930
We can clearly see 36 to 45 is the age at which most people purchase a real estate property.

141
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:58,800
It is evident that customers from 26 to 65 years old account for 71 percent of our observations.

142
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,740
But we are better than this.

143
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,250
We can calculate more statistics to get an improved idea can't we.

144
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,770
Let's do it.

145
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:13,850
The mean median and mode are the place where we usually start the mean age is forty six point fifteen

146
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,380
years the median age is 45 years and the mode is 48 years.

147
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,380
All right.

148
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,630
The mean and median are close.

149
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,790
So we have few outliers as you may recall.

150
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,770
The mean is affected by them while the median is not when the mean is higher than the median.

151
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,090
We have a positive or right skew.

152
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,900
This is confirmed by our histogram.

153
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,890
Now is the time to remind you that skewness shows too which side is the longer tail not where the data

154
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,590
is concentrated.

155
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,680
Now for the mode we have 48 years you can see that from the frequency distribution graph but not from

156
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,630
the histogram.

157
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,790
The histogram bundles data together which is good when we want to see the main trend but some information

158
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,190
like the mode is lost.

159
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,620
Finally we should inspect the variability of age before we can do so.

160
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,330
We have to see if this is sample or population data.

161
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,980
The company data is the population of all people who are our customers.

162
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,870
However our research aims to help the marketing department identify future customers.

163
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,110
Therefore our dataset is a sample drawn from all the people who will eventually buy property from our

164
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,080
company.

165
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,530
Henceforth we will use sample formulas.

166
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,360
Let's compute both the variance and the standard deviation.

167
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,980
The former is measured in squared years and the latter in years.

168
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,630
So I suggest we stick with the standard deviation then shall we.

169
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,260
The result is around 13 years.

170
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,310
This shows us how dispersed the data is.

171
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,500
What inferences can we make from this result.

172
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,570
Well that's the topic of the next section so we all have to halt here.

173
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,420
As you may have guessed our final stop is relationship between variables.

174
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,380
Let's see if age determines how expensive an apartment that customers buy.

175
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,100
Maybe younger people have less funds so they buy cheaper apartments.

176
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,430
We don't know the data will tell us first things first.

177
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,670
Let's plop the data both variables are numerical so we must use a scatter plot.

178
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,020
Here it is.

179
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,370
It is dispersed and there isn't an obvious trend.

180
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,200
Let's confirm this observation by calculating the covariance of the two variables.

181
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,580
We get this enormous value that doesn't tell us much.

182
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,020
So it's suitable to standardize it by using the correlation coefficient.

183
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,070
The value we get is minus 0.17 much better.

184
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,080
This correlation is low.

185
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,760
A common practice is to disregard correlations that are below zero point to Alright.

186
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,210
So real estate expenditure is not related to age from a previous lesson.

187
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,720
We know price and size are much more likely to be correlated right.

188
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,130
You have all the tools needed to check this through the exercise.

189
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:15,300
After this lesson so we've exhausted our statistical knowledge what can we tell the marketing team after

190
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,950
this short analysis.

191
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,080
Well we got several insights.

192
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,750
First males are more likely to sign contracts and are potentially a better audience for our ads.

193
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,600
However we have no information about their marital status.

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,280
This observation is unclear.

195
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:41,370
Second 68 percent of our sales in the US come from California with Nevada Oregon Arizona and Colorado

196
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:49,390
following behind to form 93 percent of the US customer base third 71 percent of sales were made with

197
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:57,130
customers aged between 26 and 55 years old with a mean of 46 years of age and a standard deviation of

198
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,540
13 years.

199
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,700
The distribution is right skewed so we expect younger people to buy more property than older people.

200
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,810
Finally there is no relationship between the age of a customer and the price they will pay.

201
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,280
All right that was our practical example.

202
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,500
We learned a lot about this business but we could not get amazing insights in the following sections.

203
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,270
We will learn about confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

204
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,950
This knowledge will provide us with the tools we need to make predictions about the future and make

205
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,700
data driven decisions.

206
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,980
Oh and one more thing if you like the course so far.

207
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,500
Please leave us a review.

208
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,900
It helps a lot.

209
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,250
Thanks for practicing and thanks for watching.

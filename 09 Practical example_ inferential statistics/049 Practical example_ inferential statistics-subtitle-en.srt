00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,320
Hi and welcome to our second practical example let me introduce you to the topic.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,200
You are a data analysis for Al Bundy's shoe shop.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,690
Al Bundy is a U.S. based company established 30 years ago.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,280
It also operates in Canada the U.K. and Germany.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:26,360
The firm sells mid to high end shoes ranging from 120 to 200 dollars while the shoes are of high quality.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,670
You have lots of inventory never sold.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,480
The shoes collect dust on store shelves.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,420
Inventory management is a common problem.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,680
Many if not most shops cannot determine the right number of items they need to keep in stock.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,940
The opposite problem arises too.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,480
Shops don't supply an adequate amount of goods and fail to meet the demand in their market.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,970
For instance you have surely entered a shoe shop but could not buy a specific pair of shoes because

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,160
they did not have them in stock.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,550
In this example we will examine the opposite problem.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,590
Having too much inventory.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,290
This is a more significant problem for the company as it means the company has invested in producing

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,410
or purchasing the product but could not sell it.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,760
All right.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,700
One way to solve this problem is by using confidence intervals.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,580
We have seen many examples.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,970
But here's a real life one we can see a database with the sales information about Al Bundy shop for

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,420
the years from 2014 to 2016.

23
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,580
There's Invoice Number Date country product ID and shop which depends on the country the cell gender

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,090
indicates if the product is designed for men or women as shoes differ greatly depending on gender.

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,350
Next we have shoe size.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,670
Apart from the US size system I have also included the European and the UK ones so it is easier for

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,860
you to understand the data.

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,600
If you are used to the other systems This file will be provided for you and you can check the shoe size

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,330
conversion table if you would like to do that.

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,090
Finally there is the unit price for that sale and the discount that applies.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,500
Let's begin our analysis.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,770
First we should determine if that sample or population data.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,160
It's obviously a sample not the population of sales given we have just three years of data.

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,750
Second we want to get to know the data set better.

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,610
There are two big subgroups in our data men's shoes and women choose they are different and bundling

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,000
them when making predictions will yield deceiving results not only feet differ by gender but also there

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,460
are different shoe types and models.

38
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,850
Our problem is related to inventory management.

39
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,610
Therefore we should divide our inventory and then count the frequencies the frequencies will give us

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,430
a better idea of the data OK.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,940
A good way to do that is to divide the data by shoe size.

42
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,310
I would also like to see it.

43
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:04,370
Country wise we already noted division by gender is also needed so we have three dimensions shoe size

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,060
country and gender.

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,530
A possible solution is to create two tables one for men's shoes and one for women's shoes and then proceed

46
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,620
normally.

47
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,490
That's what I will do.

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,250
Here are the two tables in the fall provided in the resources section.

49
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,520
You can see the formula I use to calculate the frequencies while Excel may be sloppy.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,230
It is still powerful to use confidence intervals.

51
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,790
We must have normally distributed data.

52
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,470
While this sounds restrictive for all practical applications it isn't.

53
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,650
We can simply apply our good old friend the central limit theorem when we are in the presence of a sum

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,720
or average of many observations.

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,530
We can assume normality in our case we are calculating average sales for a period.

56
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,900
Given that Al Bundy shop has been operating for over 30 years silty applies and we can safely continue

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,230
with our inference OK.

58
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,160
We want to estimate the number of shoes that are likely to be sold.

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,780
A 95 percent confidence interval will give us such information.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,480
We will take the last 12 months of sales and make a prediction.

61
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,220
Let's do this only for men's shoes as the main problem is identical for both genders.

62
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,860
Since people have different shoe sizes we will have to calculate 17 confidence intervals one for each

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,180
size.

64
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,450
Let's get to it.

65
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,650
First we need to calculate the means.

66
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,480
Here they are next.

67
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,140
We do not know the population variance in our sample comprises just 12 observations.

68
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,740
We have to use the t statistic.

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,220
This problem refers to the lesson on one population with population variance unknown.

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,290
We have a sample of 12 observations therefore we are looking for the t statistic for a 95 percent confidence

71
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,940
interval with 11 degrees of freedom.

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,330
It is two point eighteen.

73
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,550
Next we will compute the standard errors we will use the good old formula.

74
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,990
While it is unnecessary to go through this step as we have everything we need I will still show you

75
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,470
the margins of error as it may be interesting for some of you to examine.

76
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,990
Finally the confidence intervals are given by the following formula.

77
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,990
And this is how they look after the calculations have been carried out.

78
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,370
The result we obtained could be interpreted as follows In 95 percent of the cases.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,970
The true population mean of the sales for each shoe size will fall into the respective interval as we

80
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,720
don't want to be low on stock.

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,200
A possible solution to the problem is to get as many pairs of shoes as the closest number to the upper

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,570
limit of the confidence interval.

83
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,610
In this way you will be almost certain you won't run out of stock and shoes won't be waiting forever

84
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,890
in your storage unit.

85
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,460
Therefore we should get four pairs of men's shoes size 6 3 pairs of men's shoe size 6.5 and so on.

86
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,280
Mostly we should prepare ourselves with size 9.5 and size 16 won't yield in any sales.

87
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,080
Sorry for those of you it's size 16 feet.

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,130
I know it is hard enough to find shoes.

89
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,540
But this company won't be selling any.

90
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,620
All right.

91
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,900
We are almost done here before you go.

92
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,770
I'd like to show you another application of confidence intervals.

93
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,870
Let's say we want to use a confidence interval to see if two shops are selling the same number of shoes.

94
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:42,600
We want to know with 95 percent confidence by how much one shop outperforms the other in terms of sales.

95
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,160
You can see two tables representing the sales of women's shoes in two German shops their codes are G.R.

96
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,940
one and two.

97
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,460
Once again we have data for 2016.

98
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,820
Now an assumption we have to make is that the same people don't buy pairs of shoes from different shops.

99
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,350
Logically it makes sense that in the same year the same people don't go around different shops of the

100
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,250
same brand to buy shoes.

101
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,390
Even if this happens it is an exception not the norm.

102
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,810
Therefore we can say that two samples are independent.

103
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,670
Once again we don't know the population variance but given this is the same market in the same country

104
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,120
we can assume it is equal.

105
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,310
This implies we're in the case of independent samples with population variance.

106
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,980
Unknown but assumed to be equal in the previous case.

107
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,980
We need to calculate the means and the sample variances here.

108
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,960
We must calculate a pooled variance which is an unbiased estimator of the population variance.

109
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,380
We're in the case where we have to use the statistic with 12 plus 12 minus two degrees of freedom for

110
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,950
a 95 percent confidence.

111
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
What we get from the table is 2.0 7.

112
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,280
The respective margins of error are given by the well-known formula.

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,240
Finally the 95 percent confidence intervals are determined by the means and the margins of error.

114
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,050
We get these 15 intervals.

115
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,830
Zero is a part of all of them except for the unsellable size for all confidence intervals star in the

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,380
negatives and finish in the positives.

117
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,610
This implies we cannot conclude one shop sells more shares than the other for any size.

118
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,200
What it seems like we have no great insight.

119
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,380
That's not entirely true.

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,910
The confidence intervals we got are not consistently for one shop having higher sales or the other.

121
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,480
This is evident from the fact that some are mostly negative while others are mostly positive.

122
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:51,050
That is to show that for some sizes GBR one is likely to sell more wealth for others vice versa.

123
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,840
However our decision was that using this methodology and level of confidence we cannot really identify

124
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,500
which shop is selling more.

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:06,670
They are identical the insight we get is these two shops are so balanced in sales they may share the

126
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,980
same warehouse or exchange pairs of shoes to achieve better results.

127
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,160
They can be bundled together for any analysis action or decision needed.

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,640
On average they will probably move together if one noticeably outperforms the other.

129
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,780
We may be sure something that wasn't observed before is going on as they are predicted to remain identical.

130
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,780
All right.

131
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,660
Time to wrap up this lesson in the next section.

132
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,360
We will examine hypothesis testing.

133
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,380
Thanks for watching.

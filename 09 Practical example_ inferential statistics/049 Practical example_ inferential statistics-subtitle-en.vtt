00:00.480 --> 00:06.320
Hi and welcome to our second practical example let me introduce you to the topic.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.200
You are a data analysis for Al Bundy's shoe shop.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.690
Al Bundy is a U.S. based company established 30 years ago.

00:14.730 --> 00:18.280
It also operates in Canada the U.K. and Germany.

00:18.330 --> 00:26.360
The firm sells mid to high end shoes ranging from 120 to 200 dollars while the shoes are of high quality.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.670
You have lots of inventory never sold.

00:28.770 --> 00:31.480
The shoes collect dust on store shelves.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.420
Inventory management is a common problem.

00:34.470 --> 00:40.680
Many if not most shops cannot determine the right number of items they need to keep in stock.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.940
The opposite problem arises too.

00:42.990 --> 00:48.480
Shops don't supply an adequate amount of goods and fail to meet the demand in their market.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.970
For instance you have surely entered a shoe shop but could not buy a specific pair of shoes because

00:53.970 --> 00:56.160
they did not have them in stock.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.550
In this example we will examine the opposite problem.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.590
Having too much inventory.

01:01.770 --> 01:07.290
This is a more significant problem for the company as it means the company has invested in producing

01:07.320 --> 01:10.410
or purchasing the product but could not sell it.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.760
All right.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.700
One way to solve this problem is by using confidence intervals.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.580
We have seen many examples.

01:17.610 --> 01:23.970
But here's a real life one we can see a database with the sales information about Al Bundy shop for

01:23.970 --> 01:27.420
the years from 2014 to 2016.

01:27.490 --> 01:35.580
There's Invoice Number Date country product ID and shop which depends on the country the cell gender

01:35.590 --> 01:42.090
indicates if the product is designed for men or women as shoes differ greatly depending on gender.

01:42.090 --> 01:44.350
Next we have shoe size.

01:44.460 --> 01:50.670
Apart from the US size system I have also included the European and the UK ones so it is easier for

01:50.670 --> 01:51.860
you to understand the data.

01:51.870 --> 01:57.600
If you are used to the other systems This file will be provided for you and you can check the shoe size

01:57.600 --> 02:00.330
conversion table if you would like to do that.

02:00.330 --> 02:05.090
Finally there is the unit price for that sale and the discount that applies.

02:05.550 --> 02:08.500
Let's begin our analysis.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.770
First we should determine if that sample or population data.

02:12.780 --> 02:19.160
It's obviously a sample not the population of sales given we have just three years of data.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.750
Second we want to get to know the data set better.

02:22.770 --> 02:29.610
There are two big subgroups in our data men's shoes and women choose they are different and bundling

02:29.610 --> 02:36.000
them when making predictions will yield deceiving results not only feet differ by gender but also there

02:36.000 --> 02:38.460
are different shoe types and models.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.850
Our problem is related to inventory management.

02:41.850 --> 02:47.610
Therefore we should divide our inventory and then count the frequencies the frequencies will give us

02:47.610 --> 02:51.430
a better idea of the data OK.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.940
A good way to do that is to divide the data by shoe size.

02:55.070 --> 02:56.310
I would also like to see it.

02:56.330 --> 03:04.370
Country wise we already noted division by gender is also needed so we have three dimensions shoe size

03:04.580 --> 03:06.060
country and gender.

03:06.170 --> 03:12.530
A possible solution is to create two tables one for men's shoes and one for women's shoes and then proceed

03:12.530 --> 03:13.620
normally.

03:13.730 --> 03:16.490
That's what I will do.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.250
Here are the two tables in the fall provided in the resources section.

03:21.270 --> 03:26.520
You can see the formula I use to calculate the frequencies while Excel may be sloppy.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.230
It is still powerful to use confidence intervals.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.790
We must have normally distributed data.

03:32.790 --> 03:37.470
While this sounds restrictive for all practical applications it isn't.

03:37.530 --> 03:43.650
We can simply apply our good old friend the central limit theorem when we are in the presence of a sum

03:43.680 --> 03:45.720
or average of many observations.

03:45.750 --> 03:51.530
We can assume normality in our case we are calculating average sales for a period.

03:51.660 --> 03:57.900
Given that Al Bundy shop has been operating for over 30 years silty applies and we can safely continue

03:57.900 --> 04:01.230
with our inference OK.

04:01.350 --> 04:05.160
We want to estimate the number of shoes that are likely to be sold.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.780
A 95 percent confidence interval will give us such information.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.480
We will take the last 12 months of sales and make a prediction.

04:13.620 --> 04:19.220
Let's do this only for men's shoes as the main problem is identical for both genders.

04:19.470 --> 04:25.860
Since people have different shoe sizes we will have to calculate 17 confidence intervals one for each

04:25.860 --> 04:27.180
size.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.450
Let's get to it.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.650
First we need to calculate the means.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.480
Here they are next.

04:35.530 --> 04:41.140
We do not know the population variance in our sample comprises just 12 observations.

04:41.170 --> 04:43.740
We have to use the t statistic.

04:43.750 --> 04:49.220
This problem refers to the lesson on one population with population variance unknown.

04:49.240 --> 04:56.290
We have a sample of 12 observations therefore we are looking for the t statistic for a 95 percent confidence

04:56.290 --> 04:58.940
interval with 11 degrees of freedom.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.330
It is two point eighteen.

05:01.330 --> 05:08.550
Next we will compute the standard errors we will use the good old formula.

05:08.650 --> 05:13.990
While it is unnecessary to go through this step as we have everything we need I will still show you

05:13.990 --> 05:18.470
the margins of error as it may be interesting for some of you to examine.

05:18.630 --> 05:22.990
Finally the confidence intervals are given by the following formula.

05:23.250 --> 05:26.990
And this is how they look after the calculations have been carried out.

05:27.760 --> 05:33.370
The result we obtained could be interpreted as follows In 95 percent of the cases.

05:33.400 --> 05:39.970
The true population mean of the sales for each shoe size will fall into the respective interval as we

05:39.970 --> 05:41.720
don't want to be low on stock.

05:41.740 --> 05:47.200
A possible solution to the problem is to get as many pairs of shoes as the closest number to the upper

05:47.200 --> 05:49.570
limit of the confidence interval.

05:49.570 --> 05:54.610
In this way you will be almost certain you won't run out of stock and shoes won't be waiting forever

05:54.610 --> 05:55.890
in your storage unit.

05:56.730 --> 06:04.460
Therefore we should get four pairs of men's shoes size 6 3 pairs of men's shoe size 6.5 and so on.

06:04.590 --> 06:11.280
Mostly we should prepare ourselves with size 9.5 and size 16 won't yield in any sales.

06:11.310 --> 06:14.080
Sorry for those of you it's size 16 feet.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.130
I know it is hard enough to find shoes.

06:16.170 --> 06:20.540
But this company won't be selling any.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.620
All right.

06:21.620 --> 06:24.900
We are almost done here before you go.

06:24.930 --> 06:28.770
I'd like to show you another application of confidence intervals.

06:28.860 --> 06:34.870
Let's say we want to use a confidence interval to see if two shops are selling the same number of shoes.

06:34.950 --> 06:42.600
We want to know with 95 percent confidence by how much one shop outperforms the other in terms of sales.

06:42.620 --> 06:49.160
You can see two tables representing the sales of women's shoes in two German shops their codes are G.R.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.940
one and two.

06:51.110 --> 06:54.460
Once again we have data for 2016.

06:54.740 --> 07:00.820
Now an assumption we have to make is that the same people don't buy pairs of shoes from different shops.

07:00.830 --> 07:06.350
Logically it makes sense that in the same year the same people don't go around different shops of the

07:06.350 --> 07:08.250
same brand to buy shoes.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.390
Even if this happens it is an exception not the norm.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.810
Therefore we can say that two samples are independent.

07:16.850 --> 07:22.670
Once again we don't know the population variance but given this is the same market in the same country

07:22.760 --> 07:25.120
we can assume it is equal.

07:25.130 --> 07:29.310
This implies we're in the case of independent samples with population variance.

07:29.330 --> 07:33.980
Unknown but assumed to be equal in the previous case.

07:34.030 --> 07:37.980
We need to calculate the means and the sample variances here.

07:38.200 --> 07:43.960
We must calculate a pooled variance which is an unbiased estimator of the population variance.

07:44.320 --> 07:50.380
We're in the case where we have to use the statistic with 12 plus 12 minus two degrees of freedom for

07:50.380 --> 07:52.950
a 95 percent confidence.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.160
What we get from the table is 2.0 7.

07:56.410 --> 08:01.280
The respective margins of error are given by the well-known formula.

08:01.320 --> 08:07.240
Finally the 95 percent confidence intervals are determined by the means and the margins of error.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.050
We get these 15 intervals.

08:10.050 --> 08:16.830
Zero is a part of all of them except for the unsellable size for all confidence intervals star in the

08:16.830 --> 08:19.380
negatives and finish in the positives.

08:19.380 --> 08:25.610
This implies we cannot conclude one shop sells more shares than the other for any size.

08:25.650 --> 08:28.200
What it seems like we have no great insight.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.380
That's not entirely true.

08:30.400 --> 08:35.910
The confidence intervals we got are not consistently for one shop having higher sales or the other.

08:35.920 --> 08:43.480
This is evident from the fact that some are mostly negative while others are mostly positive.

08:43.530 --> 08:51.050
That is to show that for some sizes GBR one is likely to sell more wealth for others vice versa.

08:51.060 --> 08:57.840
However our decision was that using this methodology and level of confidence we cannot really identify

08:57.840 --> 08:59.500
which shop is selling more.

08:59.520 --> 09:06.670
They are identical the insight we get is these two shops are so balanced in sales they may share the

09:06.670 --> 09:10.980
same warehouse or exchange pairs of shoes to achieve better results.

09:11.020 --> 09:16.160
They can be bundled together for any analysis action or decision needed.

09:16.240 --> 09:21.640
On average they will probably move together if one noticeably outperforms the other.

09:21.640 --> 09:28.780
We may be sure something that wasn't observed before is going on as they are predicted to remain identical.

09:28.920 --> 09:29.780
All right.

09:29.780 --> 09:32.660
Time to wrap up this lesson in the next section.

09:32.690 --> 09:35.360
We will examine hypothesis testing.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.380
Thanks for watching.
